This time our generation will be remembered as the generation that got online, the generation that built something really and truly global.<br><br>But yes, it&#39;s also true that the Internet has problems, very serious problems, problems with security and problems with privacy.<br><br>I&#39;ve spent my career fighting these problems.<br><br>So let me show you something.<br><br>This here is Brain.<br><br>This is a floppy disk – five and a quarter-inch floppy disk infected by Brain.A.<br><br>It&#39;s the first virus we ever found for PC computers.<br><br>And we actually know where Brain came from.<br><br>We know because it says so inside the code.<br><br>Let&#39;s take a look.<br><br>All right.<br><br>That&#39;s the boot sector of an infected floppy, and if we take a closer look inside, we&#39;ll see that right there, it says, &quot;Welcome to the dungeon.&quot;<br><br>And then it continues, saying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.<br><br>And Basit and Amjad are first names, Pakistani first names.<br><br>In fact, there&#39;s a phone number and an address in Pakistan.<br><br>(Laughter) Now, 1986.<br><br>Now it&#39;s 2011.<br><br>That&#39;s 25 years ago.<br><br>The PC virus problem is 25 years old now.<br><br>So half a year ago, I decided to go to Pakistan myself.<br><br>So let&#39;s see, here&#39;s a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.<br><br>This is from the city of Lahore, which is around 300 kilometers south from Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.<br><br>Here&#39;s a typical street view.<br><br>And here&#39;s the street or road leading to this building, which is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.<br><br>And I knocked on the door.<br><br>(Laughter) You want to guess who opened the door?<br><br>Basit and Amjad; they are still there.<br><br>(Laughter) (Applause) So here standing up is Basit.<br><br>Sitting down is his brother Amjad.<br><br>These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.<br><br>Now of course, we had a very interesting discussion.<br><br>I asked them why.<br><br>I asked them how they feel about what they started.<br><br>And I got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both Basit and Amjad had had their computers infected dozens of times by completely unrelated other viruses over these years.<br><br>So there is some sort of justice in the world after all.<br><br>Now, the viruses that we used to see in the 1980s and 1990s obviously are not a problem any more.<br><br>So let me just show you a couple of examples of what they used to look like.<br><br>What I&#39;m running here is a system that enables me to run age-old programs on a modern computer.<br><br>So let me just mount some drives. Go over there.<br><br>What we have here is a list of old viruses.<br><br>So let me just run some viruses on my computer.<br><br>For example, let&#39;s go with the Centipede virus first.<br><br>And you can see at the top of the screen, there&#39;s a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by this one.<br><br>You know that you&#39;re infected because it actually shows up.<br><br>Here&#39;s another one. This is the virus called Crash, invented in Russia in 1992.<br><br>Let me show you one which actually makes some sound.<br><br>(Siren noise) And the last example, guess what the Walker virus does?<br><br>Yes, there&#39;s a guy walking across your screen once you get infected.<br><br>So it used to be fairly easy to know that you&#39;re infected by a virus, when the viruses were written by hobbyists and teenagers.<br><br>Today, they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers.<br><br>Today, viruses are a global problem.<br><br>What we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run in our labs, where we track virus infections worldwide.<br><br>So we can actually see in real time that we&#39;ve just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan and Russia and elsewhere.<br><br>In fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems through the Web, we can see in real time just some kind of idea of how many viruses, how many new examples of malware we find every single day.<br><br>Here&#39;s the latest virus we&#39;ve found, in a file called Server.exe.<br><br>And we found it right over here three seconds ago – the previous one, six seconds ago.<br><br>And if we just scroll around, it&#39;s just massive.<br><br>We find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.<br><br>And that&#39;s the last 20 minutes of malware every single day.<br><br>So where are all these coming from then?<br><br>Well today, it&#39;s the organized criminal gangs writing these viruses because they make money with their viruses.<br><br>It&#39;s gangs like – let&#39;s go to GangstaBucks.com.<br><br>This is a website operating in Moscow where these guys are buying infected computers.<br><br>So if you are a virus writer and you&#39;re capable of infecting Windows computers, but you don&#39;t know what to do with them, you can sell those infected computers – somebody else&#39;s computers – to these guys.<br><br>And they&#39;ll actually pay you money for those computers.<br><br>So how do these guys then monetize those infected computers?<br><br>Well there&#39;s multiple different ways, such as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking, or keyloggers.<br><br>Keyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view, and they record everything you type.<br><br>So you&#39;re sitting on your computer and you&#39;re doing Google searches.<br><br>Every single Google search you type is saved and sent to the criminals.<br><br>Every single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.<br><br>Same thing with every single password and so on.<br><br>But the thing that they&#39;re actually looking for most are sessions where you go online and do online purchases in any online store.<br><br>Because when you do purchases in online stores, you will be typing in your name, the delivery address, your credit card number and the credit card security codes.<br><br>And here&#39;s an example of a file we found from a server a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>That&#39;s the credit card number, that&#39;s the expiration date, that&#39;s the security code, and that&#39;s the name of the owner of the card.<br><br>Once you gain access to other people&#39;s credit card information, you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information.<br><br>And that, obviously, is a problem.<br><br>We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.<br><br>One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons.<br><br>We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen.<br><br>These guys were running an operation called I.M.U., a cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.<br><br>They are both right now on the run.<br><br>Nobody knows where they are.<br><br>U.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago, froze a Swiss bank account belonging to Mr. Jain, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.<br><br>So the amount of money online crime generates is significant.<br><br>And that means that the online criminals can actually afford to invest into their attacks.<br><br>We know that online criminals are hiring programmers, hiring testing people, testing their code, having back-end systems with SQL databases.<br><br>And they can afford to watch how we work – like how security people work – and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build.<br><br>They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage.<br><br>I mean, the Internet is international.<br><br>That&#39;s why we call it the Internet.<br><br>And if you just go and take a look at what&#39;s happening in the online world, here&#39;s a video built by Clarified Networks, which illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.<br><br>This operation, believed to be originally from Estonia, moves around from one country to another as soon as the website is tried to shut down.<br><br>So you just can&#39;t shut these guys down.<br><br>They will switch from one country to another, from one jurisdiction to another – moving around the world, using the fact that we don&#39;t have the capability to globally police operations like this.<br><br>So the Internet is as if someone would have given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world.<br><br>Now, criminals who weren&#39;t capable of reaching us before can reach us.<br><br>So how do you actually go around finding online criminals?<br><br>How do you actually track them down?<br><br>Let me give you an example.<br><br>What we have here is one exploit file.<br><br>Here, I&#39;m looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit.<br><br>And that basically means, if you&#39;re trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.<br><br>Now, if you&#39;ll take a look at this image file – well there&#39;s the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.<br><br>And that code has been encrypted, so let&#39;s decrypt it.<br><br>It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.<br><br>You just have to believe me, it is, it is.<br><br>And we can go here and actually start decrypting it.<br><br>Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.<br><br>And I know, it doesn&#39;t really look much different from the original.<br><br>But just keep staring at it.<br><br>You&#39;ll actually see that down here you can see a Web address: unionseek.com/d/ioo.exe And when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program.<br><br>And that&#39;s a backdoor which will take over your computer.<br><br>But even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we&#39;ll find this mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS.<br><br>That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.<br><br>It&#39;s not used for anything.<br><br>And I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.<br><br>So obviously I Googled for it.<br><br>I got zero hits; wasn&#39;t there.<br><br>So I spoke with the guys at the lab.<br><br>And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia.<br><br>And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg.<br><br>For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that.<br><br>So I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg, and through a long road, we eventually found this one particular website.<br><br>Here&#39;s this Russian guy who&#39;s been operating online for a number of years who runs his own website, and he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.<br><br>And on this blog, he blogs about his life, about his life in St. Petersburg – he&#39;s in his early 20s – about his cat, about his girlfriend.<br><br>And he drives a very nice car.<br><br>In fact, this guy drives a Mercedes-Benz S600 V12 with a six-liter engine with more than 400 horsepower.<br><br>Now that&#39;s a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.<br><br>How do I know about this car?<br><br>Because he blogged about the car.<br><br>He actually had a car accident.<br><br>In downtown St. Petersburg, he actually crashed his car into another car.<br><br>And he put blogged images about the car accident – that&#39;s his Mercedes – right here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.<br><br>And you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara ends in 78RUS.<br><br>And if you actually take a look at the scene picture, you can see that the plate of the Mercedes is O600KO78RUS.<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a lawyer, but if I would be, this is where I would say, &quot;I rest my case.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) So what happens when online criminals are caught?<br><br>Well in most cases it never gets this far.<br><br>The vast majority of the online crime cases, we don&#39;t even know which continent the attacks are coming from.<br><br>And even if we are able to find online criminals, quite often there is no outcome.<br><br>The local police don&#39;t act, or if they do, there&#39;s not enough evidence, or for some reason we can&#39;t take them down.<br><br>I wish it would be easier; unfortunately it isn&#39;t.<br><br>But things are also changing at a very rapid pace.<br><br>You&#39;ve all heard about things like Stuxnet.<br><br>So if you look at what Stuxnet did is that it infected these.<br><br>That&#39;s a Siemens S7-400 PLC, programmable logic [controller].<br><br>And this is what runs our infrastructure.<br><br>This is what runs everything around us.<br><br>PLC&#39;s, these small boxes which have no display, no keyboard, which are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.<br><br>For example, the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these.<br><br>And when Stuxnet infects one of these, that&#39;s a massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about.<br><br>Because everything around us is being run by these.<br><br>I mean, we have critical infrastructure.<br><br>You go to any factory, any power plant, any chemical plant, any food processing plant, you look around – everything is being run by computers.<br><br>Everything is being run by computers.<br><br>Everything is reliant on these computers working.<br><br>We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working.<br><br>And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us.<br><br>We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.<br><br>(Laughter) (Applause) So preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren&#39;t there.<br><br>It&#39;s actually very basic stuff – thinking about continuity, thinking about backups, thinking about the things that actually matter.<br><br>Now I told you – (Laughter) I love the Internet. I do.<br><br>Think about all the services we have online.<br><br>Think about if they are taken away from you, if one day you don&#39;t actually have them for some reason or another.<br><br>I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I&#39;m worried that we might not see that.<br><br>I&#39;m worried that we are running into problems because of online crime.<br><br>Online crime is the one thing that might take these things away from us.<br><br>(Laughter) I&#39;ve spent my life defending the Net, and I do feel that if we don&#39;t fight online crime, we are running a risk of losing it all.<br><br>We have to do this globally, and we have to do it right now.<br><br>What we need is more global, international law enforcement work to find online criminal gangs – these organized gangs that are making millions out of their attacks.<br><br>That&#39;s much more important than running anti-viruses or running firewalls.<br><br>What actually matters is actually finding the people behind these attacks, and even more importantly, we have to find the people who are about to become part of this online world of crime, but haven&#39;t yet done it.<br><br>We have to find the people with the skills, but without the opportunities and give them the opportunities to use their skills for good.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

We are everyone. We are no one. We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. We are but the base of chaos.<br><br>Misha Glenny: Anonymous, ladies and gentlemen – a sophisticated group of politically motivated hackers who have emerged in 2011. And they’re pretty scary. You never know when they’re going to attack next, who or what the consequences will be. But interestingly, they have a sense of humor. These guys hacked into Fox News’ Twitter account to announce President Obama’s assassination. Now you can imagine the panic that would have generated in the newsroom at Fox. “What do we do now? Put on a black armband, or crack open the champagne?” (Laughter) And of course, who could escape the irony of a member of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. being a victim of hacking for a change.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>Sometimes you turn on the news and you say, “Is there anyone left to hack?” Sony Playstation Network – done, the government of Turkey – tick, Britain’s Serious Organized Crime Agency – a breeze, the CIA – falling off a log. In fact, a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world: those that know they’ve been hacked, and those that don’t. I mean three companies providing cybersecurity services to the FBI have been hacked. Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven’s sake?<br><br>Anyway, this mysterious group Anonymous – and they would say this themselves – they are providing a service by demonstrating how useless companies are at protecting our data. But there is also a very serious aspect to Anonymous – they are ideologically driven. They claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy. They say that governments are trying to take over the Internet and control it, and that they, Anonymous, are the authentic voice of resistance – be it against Middle Eastern dictatorships, against global media corporations, or against intelligence agencies, or whoever it is. And their politics are not entirely unattractive. Okay, they’re a little inchoate. There’s a strong whiff of half-baked anarchism about them. But one thing is true: we are at the beginning of a mighty struggle for control of the Internet. The Web links everything, and very soon it will mediate most human activity. Because the Internet has fashioned a new and complicated environment for an old-age dilemma that pits the demands of security with the desire for freedom.<br><br>Now this is a very complicated struggle. And unfortunately, for mortals like you and me, we probably can’t understand it very well. Nonetheless, in an unexpected attack of hubris a couple of years ago, I decided I would try and do that. And I sort of get it. These were the various things that I was looking at as I was trying to understand it. But in order to try and explain the whole thing, I would need another 18 minutes or so to do it, so you’re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasion, and let me assure you that all of these issues are involved in cybersecurity and control of the Internet one way or the other, but in a configuration that even Stephen Hawking would probably have difficulty trying to get his head around. So there you are. And as you see, in the middle, there is our old friend, the hacker. The hacker is absolutely central to many of the political, social and economic issues affecting the Net. And so I thought to myself, “Well, these are the guys who I want to talk to.” And what do you know, nobody else does talk to the hackers. They’re completely anonymous, as it were.<br><br>So despite the fact that we are beginning to pour billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, into cybersecurity – for the most extraordinary technical solutions – no one wants to talk to these guys, the hackers, who are doing everything. Instead, we prefer these really dazzling technological solutions, which cost a huge amount of money. And so nothing is going into the hackers. Well, I say nothing, but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in Turin, Italy called the Hackers Profiling Project. And they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics, into the abilities and the socialization of hackers. But because they’re a U.N. operation, maybe that’s why governments and corporations are not that interested in them. Because it’s a U.N. operation, of course, it lacks funding. But I think they’re doing very important work. Because where we have a surplus of technology in the cybersecurity industry, we have a definite lack of – call me old-fashioned – human intelligence.<br><br>Now, so far I’ve mentioned the hackers Anonymous who are a politically motivated hacking group. Of course, the criminal justice system treats them as common old garden criminals. But interestingly, Anonymous does not make use of its hacked information for financial gain. But what about the real cybercriminals? Well real organized crime on the Internet goes back about 10 years when a group of gifted Ukrainian hackers developed a website, which led to the industrialization of cybercrime. Welcome to the now forgotten realm of CarderPlanet. This is how they were advertising themselves a decade ago on the Net. Now CarderPlanet was very interesting. Cybercriminals would go there to buy and sell stolen credit card details, to exchange information about new malware that was out there. And remember, this is a time when we’re seeing for the first time so-called off-the-shelf malware. This is ready for use, out-of-the-box stuff, which you can deploy even if you’re not a terribly sophisticated hacker.<br><br>And so CarderPlanet became a sort of supermarket for cybercriminals. And its creators were incredibly smart and entrepreneurial, because they were faced with one enormous challenge as cybercriminals. And that challenge is: How do you do business, how do you trust somebody on the Web who you want to do business with when you know that they’re a criminal? (Laughter) It’s axiomatic that they’re dodgy, and they’re going to want to try and rip you off. So the family, as the inner core of CarderPlanet was known, came up with this brilliant idea called the escrow system. They appointed an officer who would mediate between the vendor and the purchaser. The vendor, say, had stolen credit card details; the purchaser wanted to get a hold of them. The purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally, and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details. And the officer would then verify if the stolen credit card worked. And if they did, he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser. And it was this which completely revolutionized cybercrime on the Web. And after that, it just went wild. We had a champagne decade for people who we know as Carders.<br><br>Now I spoke to one of these Carders who we’ll call RedBrigade – although that wasn’t even his proper nickname – but I promised I wouldn’t reveal who he was. And he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sprees in New York, taking out $10,000 from an ATM here, $30,000 from an ATM there, using cloned credit cards. He was making, on average a week, $150,000 – tax free of course. And he said that he had so much money stashed in his upper-East side apartment at one point that he just didn’t know what to do with it and actually fell into a depression. But that’s a slightly different story, which I won’t go into now. Now the interesting thing about RedBrigade is that he wasn’t an advanced hacker. He sort of understood the technology, and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a Carder, but he didn’t spend his days and nights bent over a computer, eating pizza, drinking coke and that sort of thing. He was out there on the town having a fab time enjoying the high life.<br><br>And this is because hackers are only one element in a cybercriminal enterprise. And often they’re the most vulnerable element of all. And I want to explain this to you by introducing you to six characters who I met while I was doing this research. Dimitry Golubov, aka SCRIPT – born in Odessa, Ukraine in 1982. Now he developed his social and moral compass on the Black Sea port during the 1990s. This was a sink-or-swim environment where involvement in criminal or corrupt activities was entirely necessary if you wanted to survive. As an accomplished computer user, what Dimitry did was to transfer the gangster capitalism of his hometown onto the Worldwide Web. And he did a great job in it. You have to understand though that from his ninth birthday, the only environment he knew was gangsterism. He knew no other way of making a living and making money.<br><br>Then we have Renukanth Subramaniam, aka JiLsi – founder of DarkMarket, born in Colombo, Sri Lanka. As an eight year-old, he and his parents fled the Sri Lankan capital because Singhalese mobs were roaming the city, looking for Tamils like Renu to murder. At 11, he was interrogated by the Sri Lankan military, accused of being a terrorist, and his parents sent him on his own to Britain as a refugee seeking political asylum. At 13, with only little English and being bullied at school, he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability, but he was soon being seduced by people on the Internet. He was convicted of mortgage and credit card fraud, and he will be released from Wormwood Scrubs jail in London in 2012.<br><br>Matrix001, who was an administrator at DarkMarket. Born in Southern Germany to a stable and well-respected middle class family, his obsession with gaming as a teenager led him to hacking. And he was soon controlling huge servers around the world where he stored his games that he had cracked and pirated. His slide into criminality was incremental. And when he finally woke up to his situation and understood the implications, he was already in too deep.<br><br>Max Vision, aka ICEMAN – mastermind of CardersMarket. Born in Meridian, Idaho. Max Vision was one of the best penetration testers working out of Santa Clara, California in the late 90s for private companies and voluntarily for the FBI. Now in the late 1990s, he discovered a vulnerability on all U.S. government networks, and he went in and patched it up – because this included nuclear research facilities – sparing the American government a huge security embarrassment. But also, because he was an inveterate hacker, he left a tiny digital wormhole through which he alone could crawl. But this was spotted by an eagle-eye investigator, and he was convicted. At his open prison, he came under the influence of financial fraudsters, and those financial fraudsters persuaded him to work for them on his release. And this man with a planetary-sized brain is now serving a 13-year sentence in California.<br><br>Adewale Taiwo, aka FreddyBB – master bank account cracker from Abuja in Nigeria. He set up his prosaically entitled newsgroup, bankfrauds@yahoo.co.uk before arriving in Britain in 2005 to take a Masters in chemical engineering at Manchester University. He impressed in the private sector, developing chemical applications for the oil industry while simultaneously running a worldwide bank and credit card fraud operation that was worth millions until his arrest in 2008.<br><br>And then finally, Cagatay Evyapan, aka Cha0 – one of the most remarkable hackers ever, from Ankara in Turkey. He combined the tremendous skills of a geek with the suave social engineering skills of the master criminal. One of the smartest people I’ve ever met. He also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals.<br><br>Now the important thing about all of these people is they share certain characteristics despite the fact that they come from very different environments. They are all people who learned their hacking skills in their early to mid-teens. They are all people who demonstrate advanced ability in maths and the sciences. Remember that, when they developed those hacking skills, their moral compass had not yet developed. And most of them, with the exception of SCRIPT and Cha0, they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world – only on the Web.<br><br>And the other thing is the high incidence of hackers like these who have characteristics which are consistent with Asperger’s syndrome. Now I discussed this with Professor Simon Baron-Cohen who’s the professor of developmental psychopathology at Cambridge. And he has done path-breaking work on autism and confirmed, also for the authorities here, that Gary McKinnon – who is wanted by the United States for hacking into the Pentagon – suffers from Asperger’s and a secondary condition of depression. And Baron-Cohen explained that certain disabilities can manifest themselves in the hacking and computing world as tremendous skills, and that we should not be throwing in jail people who have such disabilities and skills because they have lost their way socially or been duped.<br><br>Now I think we’re missing a trick here, because I don’t think people like Max Vision should be in jail. And let me be blunt about this. In China, in Russia and in loads of other countries that are developing cyber-offensive capabilities, this is exactly what they are doing. They are recruiting hackers both before and after they become involved in criminal and industrial espionage activities – are mobilizing them on behalf of the state. We need to engage and find ways of offering guidance to these young people, because they are a remarkable breed. And if we rely, as we do at the moment, solely on the criminal justice system and the threat of punitive sentences, we will be nurturing a monster we cannot tame.<br><br>Thank you very much for listening.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>Chris Anderson: So your idea worth spreading is hire hackers. How would someone get over that kind of fear that the hacker they hire might preserve that little teensy wormhole?<br><br>MG: I think to an extent, you have to understand that it’s axiomatic among hackers that they do that. They’re just relentless and obsessive about what they do. But all of the people who I’ve spoken to who have fallen foul of the law, they have all said, “Please, please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry. We just never knew how to get there, what we were doing. We want to work with you.”<br><br>Chris Anderson: Okay, well that makes sense. Thanks a lot Misha.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

with a bunch of mathematicians, philosophers and computer scientists, and we sit around and think about the future of machine intelligence, among other things.<br><br>Some people think that some of these things are sort of science fiction-y, far out there, crazy.<br><br>But I like to say, okay, let&#39;s look at the modern human condition.<br><br>(Laughter) This is the normal way for things to be.<br><br>But if we think about it, we are actually recently arrived guests on this planet, the human species.<br><br>Think about if Earth was created one year ago, the human species, then, would be 10 minutes old.<br><br>The industrial era started two seconds ago.<br><br>Another way to look at this is to think of world GDP over the last 10,000 years, I&#39;ve actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph.<br><br>It looks like this.<br><br>(Laughter) It&#39;s a curious shape for a normal condition.<br><br>I sure wouldn&#39;t want to sit on it.<br><br>(Laughter) Let&#39;s ask ourselves, what is the cause of this current anomaly?<br><br>Some people would say it&#39;s technology.<br><br>Now it&#39;s true, technology has accumulated through human history, and right now, technology advances extremely rapidly – that is the proximate cause, that&#39;s why we are currently so very productive.<br><br>But I like to think back further to the ultimate cause.<br><br>Look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen: We have Kanzi – he&#39;s mastered 200 lexical tokens, an incredible feat.<br><br>And Ed Witten unleashed the second superstring revolution.<br><br>If we look under the hood, this is what we find: basically the same thing.<br><br>One is a little larger, it maybe also has a few tricks in the exact way it&#39;s wired.<br><br>These invisible differences cannot be too complicated, however, because there have only been 250,000 generations since our last common ancestor.<br><br>We know that complicated mechanisms take a long time to evolve.<br><br>So a bunch of relatively minor changes take us from Kanzi to Witten, from broken-off tree branches to intercontinental ballistic missiles.<br><br>So this then seems pretty obvious that everything we&#39;ve achieved, and everything we care about, depends crucially on some relatively minor changes that made the human mind.<br><br>And the corollary, of course, is that any further changes that could significantly change the substrate of thinking could have potentially enormous consequences.<br><br>Some of my colleagues think we&#39;re on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate, and that is machine superintelligence.<br><br>Artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box.<br><br>You would have human programmers that would painstakingly handcraft knowledge items.<br><br>You build up these expert systems, and they were kind of useful for some purposes, but they were very brittle, you couldn&#39;t scale them.<br><br>Basically, you got out only what you put in.<br><br>But since then, a paradigm shift has taken place in the field of artificial intelligence.<br><br>Today, the action is really around machine learning.<br><br>So rather than handcrafting knowledge representations and features, we create algorithms that learn, often from raw perceptual data.<br><br>Basically the same thing that the human infant does.<br><br>The result is A.I. that is not limited to one domain – the same system can learn to translate between any pairs of languages, or learn to play any computer game on the Atari console.<br><br>Now of course, A.I. is still nowhere near having the same powerful, cross-domain ability to learn and plan as a human being has.<br><br>The cortex still has some algorithmic tricks that we don&#39;t yet know how to match in machines.<br><br>So the question is, how far are we from being able to match those tricks?<br><br>A couple of years ago, we did a survey of some of the world&#39;s leading A.I. experts, to see what they think, and one of the questions we asked was, &quot;By which year do you think there is a 50 percent probability that we will have achieved human-level machine intelligence?&quot;<br><br>We defined human-level here as the ability to perform almost any job at least as well as an adult human, so real human-level, not just within some limited domain.<br><br>And the median answer was 2040 or 2050, depending on precisely which group of experts we asked.<br><br>Now, it could happen much, much later, or sooner, the truth is nobody really knows.<br><br>What we do know is that the ultimate limit to information processing in a machine substrate lies far outside the limits in biological tissue.<br><br>This comes down to physics.<br><br>A biological neuron fires, maybe, at 200 hertz, 200 times a second.<br><br>But even a present-day transistor operates at the Gigahertz.<br><br>Neurons propagate slowly in axons, 100 meters per second, tops.<br><br>But in computers, signals can travel at the speed of light.<br><br>There are also size limitations, like a human brain has to fit inside a cranium, but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger.<br><br>So the potential for superintelligence lies dormant in matter, much like the power of the atom lay dormant throughout human history, patiently waiting there until 1945.<br><br>In this century, scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence.<br><br>And I think we might then see an intelligence explosion.<br><br>Now most people, when they think about what is smart and what is dumb, I think have in mind a picture roughly like this.<br><br>So at one end we have the village idiot, and then far over at the other side we have Ed Witten, or Albert Einstein, or whoever your favorite guru is.<br><br>But I think that from the point of view of artificial intelligence, the true picture is actually probably more like this: AI starts out at this point here, at zero intelligence, and then, after many, many years of really hard work, maybe eventually we get to mouse-level artificial intelligence, something that can navigate cluttered environments as well as a mouse can.<br><br>And then, after many, many more years of really hard work, lots of investment, maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee-level artificial intelligence.<br><br>And then, after even more years of really, really hard work, we get to village idiot artificial intelligence.<br><br>And a few moments later, we are beyond Ed Witten.<br><br>The train doesn&#39;t stop at Humanville Station.<br><br>It&#39;s likely, rather, to swoosh right by.<br><br>Now this has profound implications, particularly when it comes to questions of power.<br><br>For example, chimpanzees are strong – pound for pound, a chimpanzee is about twice as strong as a fit human male.<br><br>And yet, the fate of Kanzi and his pals depends a lot more on what we humans do than on what the chimpanzees do themselves.<br><br>Once there is superintelligence, the fate of humanity may depend on what the superintelligence does.<br><br>Think about it: Machine intelligence is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make.<br><br>Machines will then be better at inventing than we are, and they&#39;ll be doing so on digital timescales.<br><br>What this means is basically a telescoping of the future.<br><br>Think of all the crazy technologies that you could have imagined maybe humans could have developed in the fullness of time: cures for aging, space colonization, self-replicating nanobots or uploading of minds into computers, all kinds of science fiction-y stuff that&#39;s nevertheless consistent with the laws of physics.<br><br>All of this superintelligence could develop, and possibly quite rapidly.<br><br>Now, a superintelligence with such technological maturity would be extremely powerful, and at least in some scenarios, it would be able to get what it wants.<br><br>We would then have a future that would be shaped by the preferences of this A.I.<br><br>Now a good question is, what are those preferences?<br><br>Here it gets trickier.<br><br>To make any headway with this, we must first of all avoid anthropomorphizing.<br><br>And this is ironic because every newspaper article about the future of A.I.<br><br>has a picture of this: So I think what we need to do is to conceive of the issue more abstractly, not in terms of vivid Hollywood scenarios.<br><br>We need to think of intelligence as an optimization process, a process that steers the future into a particular set of configurations.<br><br>A superintelligence is a really strong optimization process.<br><br>It&#39;s extremely good at using available means to achieve a state in which its goal is realized.<br><br>This means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense, and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful.<br><br>Suppose we give an A.I. the goal to make humans smile.<br><br>When the A.I. is weak, it performs useful or amusing actions that cause its user to smile.<br><br>When the A.I. becomes superintelligent, it realizes that there is a more effective way to achieve this goal: take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins.<br><br>Another example, suppose we give A.I. the goal to solve a difficult mathematical problem.<br><br>When the A.I. becomes superintelligent, it realizes that the most effective way to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer, so as to increase its thinking capacity.<br><br>And notice that this gives the A.I.s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of.<br><br>Human beings in this model are threats, we could prevent the mathematical problem from being solved.<br><br>Of course, perceivably things won&#39;t go wrong in these particular ways; these are cartoon examples.<br><br>But the general point here is important: if you create a really powerful optimization process to maximize for objective x, you better make sure that your definition of x incorporates everything you care about.<br><br>This is a lesson that&#39;s also taught in many a myth.<br><br>King Midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold.<br><br>He touches his daughter, she turns into gold.<br><br>He touches his food, it turns into gold.<br><br>This could become practically relevant, not just as a metaphor for greed, but as an illustration of what happens if you create a powerful optimization process and give it misconceived or poorly specified goals.<br><br>Now you might say, if a computer starts sticking electrodes into people&#39;s faces, we&#39;d just shut it off.<br><br>A, this is not necessarily so easy to do if we&#39;ve grown dependent on the system – like, where is the off switch to the Internet?<br><br>B, why haven&#39;t the chimpanzees flicked the off switch to humanity, or the Neanderthals?<br><br>They certainly had reasons.<br><br>We have an off switch, for example, right here.<br><br>(Choking) The reason is that we are an intelligent adversary; we can anticipate threats and plan around them.<br><br>But so could a superintelligent agent, and it would be much better at that than we are.<br><br>The point is, we should not be confident that we have this under control here.<br><br>And we could try to make our job a little bit easier by, say, putting the A.I. in a box, like a secure software environment, a virtual reality simulation from which it cannot escape.<br><br>But how confident can we be that the A.I. couldn&#39;t find a bug.<br><br>Given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time, I&#39;d say, probably not very confident.<br><br>So we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap, but again, like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering.<br><br>Right now, as I speak, I&#39;m sure there is some employee out there somewhere who has been talked into handing out her account details by somebody claiming to be from the I.T. department.<br><br>More creative scenarios are also possible, like if you&#39;re the A.I., you can imagine wiggling electrodes around in your internal circuitry to create radio waves that you can use to communicate.<br><br>Or maybe you could pretend to malfunction, and then when the programmers open you up to see what went wrong with you, they look at the source code – Bam! – the manipulation can take place.<br><br>Or it could output the blueprint to a really nifty technology, and when we implement it, it has some surreptitious side effect that the A.I. had planned.<br><br>The point here is that we should not be confident in our ability to keep a superintelligent genie locked up in its bottle forever.<br><br>Sooner or later, it will out.<br><br>I believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent A.I.<br><br>such that even if – when – it escapes, it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values.<br><br>I see no way around this difficult problem.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved.<br><br>We wouldn&#39;t have to write down a long list of everything we care about, or worse yet, spell it out in some computer language like C++ or Python, that would be a task beyond hopeless.<br><br>Instead, we would create an A.I.<br><br>that uses its intelligence to learn what we value, and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of.<br><br>We would thus leverage its intelligence as much as possible to solve the problem of value-loading.<br><br>This can happen, and the outcome could be very good for humanity.<br><br>But it doesn&#39;t happen automatically.<br><br>The initial conditions for the intelligence explosion might need to be set up in just the right way if we are to have a controlled detonation.<br><br>The values that the A.I. has need to match ours, not just in the familiar context, like where we can easily check how the A.I. behaves, but also in all novel contexts that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future.<br><br>And there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved, sorted out: the exact details of its decision theory, how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth.<br><br>So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult – not as difficult as making a superintelligent A.I., but fairly difficult.<br><br>Here is the worry: Making superintelligent A.I.<br><br>is a really hard challenge.<br><br>Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that.<br><br>The risk is that if somebody figures out how to crack the first challenge without also having cracked the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety.<br><br>So I think that we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance, so that we have it available by the time it is needed.<br><br>Now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the architecture where it will be implemented.<br><br>But the more of the control problem that we solve in advance, the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well.<br><br>This to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing and I can imagine that if things turn out okay, that people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

Lee Sedol is one of the world’s greatest Go players, and he’s having what my friends in Silicon Valley call a “Holy Cow” moment –<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>a moment where we realize that AI is actually progressing a lot faster than we expected. So humans have lost on the Go board. What about the real world?<br><br>Well, the real world is much bigger, much more complicated than the Go board. It’s a lot less visible, but it’s still a decision problem. And if we think about some of the technologies that are coming down the pike … Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading is not yet happening in machines, at least with understanding. But that will happen, and when that happens, very soon afterwards, machines will have read everything that the human race has ever written. And that will enable machines, along with the ability to look further ahead than humans can, as we’ve already seen in Go, if they also have access to more information, they’ll be able to make better decisions in the real world than we can. So is that a good thing? Well, I hope so.<br><br>Our entire civilization, everything that we value, is based on our intelligence. And if we had access to a lot more intelligence, then there’s really no limit to what the human race can do. And I think this could be, as some people have described it, the biggest event in human history. So why are people saying things like this, that AI might spell the end of the human race? Is this a new thing? Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking?<br><br>Actually, no. This idea has been around for a while. Here’s a quotation: “Even if we could keep the machines in a subservient position, for instance, by turning off the power at strategic moments” – and I’ll come back to that “turning off the power” idea later on – “we should, as a species, feel greatly humbled.” So who said this? This is Alan Turing in 1951. Alan Turing, as you know, is the father of computer science and in many ways, the father of AI as well. So if we think about this problem, the problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species, we might call this “the gorilla problem,” because gorillas’ ancestors did this a few million years ago, and now we can ask the gorillas: Was this a good idea?<br><br>So here they are having a meeting to discuss whether it was a good idea, and after a little while, they conclude, no, this was a terrible idea. Our species is in dire straits. In fact, you can see the existential sadness in their eyes.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So this queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species is maybe not a good idea – what can we do about that? Well, really nothing, except stop doing AI, and because of all the benefits that I mentioned and because I’m an AI researcher, I’m not having that. I actually want to be able to keep doing AI.<br><br>So we actually need to nail down the problem a bit more. What exactly is the problem? Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe?<br><br>So here’s another quotation: “We had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire.” This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960, shortly after he watched one of the very early learning systems learn to play checkers better than its creator. But this could equally have been said by King Midas. King Midas said, “I want everything I touch to turn to gold,” and he got exactly what he asked for. That was the purpose that he put into the machine, so to speak, and then his food and his drink and his relatives turned to gold and he died in misery and starvation. So we’ll call this “the King Midas problem” of stating an objective which is not, in fact, truly aligned with what we want. In modern terms, we call this “the value alignment problem.”<br><br>Putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem. There’s another part. If you put an objective into a machine, even something as simple as, “Fetch the coffee,” the machine says to itself, “Well, how might I fail to fetch the coffee? Someone might switch me off. OK, I have to take steps to prevent that. I will disable my ‘off’ switch. I will do anything to defend myself against interference with this objective that I have been given.” So this single-minded pursuit in a very defensive mode of an objective that is, in fact, not aligned with the true objectives of the human race – that’s the problem that we face. And in fact, that’s the high-value takeaway from this talk. If you want to remember one thing, it’s that you can’t fetch the coffee if you’re dead.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>It’s very simple. Just remember that. Repeat it to yourself three times a day.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And in fact, this is exactly the plot of “2001: [A Space Odyssey]” HAL has an objective, a mission, which is not aligned with the objectives of the humans, and that leads to this conflict. Now fortunately, HAL is not superintelligent. He’s pretty smart, but eventually Dave outwits him and manages to switch him off. But we might not be so lucky. So what are we going to do?<br><br>I’m trying to redefine AI to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives. There are three principles involved. The first one is a principle of altruism, if you like, that the robot’s only objective is to maximize the realization of human objectives, of human values. And by values here I don’t mean touchy-feely, goody-goody values. I just mean whatever it is that the human would prefer their life to be like. And so this actually violates Asimov’s law that the robot has to protect its own existence. It has no interest in preserving its existence whatsoever.<br><br>The second law is a law of humility, if you like. And this turns out to be really important to make robots safe. It says that the robot does not know what those human values are, so it has to maximize them, but it doesn’t know what they are. And that avoids this problem of single-minded pursuit of an objective. This uncertainty turns out to be crucial.<br><br>Now, in order to be useful to us, it has to have some idea of what we want. It obtains that information primarily by observation of human choices, so our own choices reveal information about what it is that we prefer our lives to be like. So those are the three principles. Let’s see how that applies to this question of: “Can you switch the machine off?” as Turing suggested.<br><br>So here’s a PR2 robot. This is one that we have in our lab, and it has a big red “off” switch right on the back. The question is: Is it going to let you switch it off? If we do it the classical way, we give it the objective of, “Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee, I can’t fetch the coffee if I’m dead,” so obviously the PR2 has been listening to my talk, and so it says, therefore, “I must disable my ‘off’ switch, and probably taser all the other people in Starbucks who might interfere with me.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So this seems to be inevitable, right? This kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable, and it follows from having a concrete, definite objective.<br><br>So what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective? Well, it reasons in a different way. It says, “OK, the human might switch me off, but only if I’m doing something wrong. Well, I don’t really know what wrong is, but I know that I don’t want to do it.” So that’s the first and second principles right there. “So I should let the human switch me off.” And in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot has to allow the human to switch it off, and it’s directly tied to the degree of uncertainty about the underlying objective.<br><br>And then when the machine is switched off, that third principle comes into play. It learns something about the objectives it should be pursuing, because it learns that what it did wasn’t right. In fact, we can, with suitable use of Greek symbols, as mathematicians usually do, we can actually prove a theorem that says that such a robot is provably beneficial to the human. You are provably better off with a machine that’s designed in this way than without it. So this is a very simple example, but this is the first step in what we’re trying to do with human-compatible AI.<br><br>Now, this third principle, I think is the one that you’re probably scratching your head over. You’re probably thinking, “Well, you know, I behave badly. I don’t want my robot to behave like me. I sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge. I do this and that.” There’s all kinds of things you don’t want the robot doing. But in fact, it doesn’t quite work that way. Just because you behave badly doesn’t mean the robot is going to copy your behavior. It’s going to understand your motivations and maybe help you resist them, if appropriate. But it’s still difficult. What we’re trying to do, in fact, is to allow machines to predict for any person and for any possible life that they could live, and the lives of everybody else: Which would they prefer? And there are many, many difficulties involved in doing this; I don’t expect that this is going to get solved very quickly. The real difficulties, in fact, are us.<br><br>As I have already mentioned, we behave badly. In fact, some of us are downright nasty. Now the robot, as I said, doesn’t have to copy the behavior. The robot does not have any objective of its own. It’s purely altruistic. And it’s not designed just to satisfy the desires of one person, the user, but in fact it has to respect the preferences of everybody. So it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness, and it can even understand that your nastiness, for example, you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school. It can understand that; it doesn’t mean it’s going to steal. In fact, it’ll just help you send your kids to school.<br><br>We are also computationally limited. Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player, but he still lost. So if we look at his actions, he took an action that lost the game. That doesn’t mean he wanted to lose. So to understand his behavior, we actually have to invert through a model of human cognition that includes our computational limitations – a very complicated model. But it’s still something that we can work on understanding.<br><br>Probably the most difficult part, from my point of view as an AI researcher, is the fact that there are lots of us, and so the machine has to somehow trade off, weigh up the preferences of many different people, and there are different ways to do that. Economists, sociologists, moral philosophers have understood that, and we are actively looking for collaboration.<br><br>Let’s have a look and see what happens when you get that wrong. So you can have a conversation, for example, with your intelligent personal assistant that might be available in a few years’ time. Think of a Siri on steroids. So Siri says, “Your wife called to remind you about dinner tonight.” And of course, you’ve forgotten. “What? What dinner? What are you talking about?”<br><br>“Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm.”<br><br>“I can’t do that. I’m meeting with the secretary-general at 7:30. How could this have happened?”<br><br>“Well, I did warn you, but you overrode my recommendation.”<br><br>“Well, what am I going to do? I can’t just tell him I’m too busy.”<br><br>“Don’t worry. I arranged for his plane to be delayed.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>“Some kind of computer malfunction.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>“Really? You can do that?”<br><br>“He sends his profound apologies and looks forward to meeting you for lunch tomorrow.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So the values here – there’s a slight mistake going on. This is clearly following my wife’s values which is “Happy wife, happy life.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>It could go the other way. You could come home after a hard day’s work, and the computer says, “Long day?”<br><br>“Yes, I didn’t even have time for lunch.”<br><br>“You must be very hungry.”<br><br>“Starving, yeah. Could you make some dinner?”<br><br>“There’s something I need to tell you.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>“There are humans in South Sudan who are in more urgent need than you.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>“So I’m leaving. Make your own dinner.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So we have to solve these problems, and I’m looking forward to working on them.<br><br>There are reasons for optimism. One reason is, there is a massive amount of data. Because remember – I said they’re going to read everything the human race has ever written. Most of what we write about is human beings doing things and other people getting upset about it. So there’s a massive amount of data to learn from.<br><br>There’s also a very strong economic incentive to get this right. So imagine your domestic robot’s at home. You’re late from work again and the robot has to feed the kids, and the kids are hungry and there’s nothing in the fridge. And the robot sees the cat.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And the robot hasn’t quite learned the human value function properly, so it doesn’t understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So then what happens? Well, it happens like this: “Deranged robot cooks kitty for family dinner.” That one incident would be the end of the domestic robot industry. So there’s a huge incentive to get this right long before we reach superintelligent machines.<br><br>So to summarize: I’m actually trying to change the definition of AI so that we have provably beneficial machines. And the principles are: machines that are altruistic, that want to achieve only our objectives, but that are uncertain about what those objectives are, and will watch all of us to learn more about what it is that we really want. And hopefully in the process, we will learn to be better people. Thank you very much.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart. We’re going to stand here a bit because I think they’re setting up for our next speaker.<br><br>A couple of questions. So the idea of programming in ignorance seems intuitively really powerful. As you get to superintelligence, what’s going to stop a robot reading literature and discovering this idea that knowledge is actually better than ignorance and still just shifting its own goals and rewriting that programming?<br><br>Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want it to learn more, as I said, about our objectives. It’ll only become more certain as it becomes more correct, so the evidence is there and it’s going to be designed to interpret it correctly. It will understand, for example, that books are very biased in the evidence they contain. They only talk about kings and princes and elite white male people doing stuff. So it’s a complicated problem, but as it learns more about our objectives it will become more and more useful to us.<br><br>CA: And you couldn’t just boil it down to one law, you know, hardwired in: “if any human ever tries to switch me off, I comply. I comply.”<br><br>SR: Absolutely not. That would be a terrible idea. So imagine that you have a self-driving car and you want to send your five-year-old off to preschool. Do you want your five-year-old to be able to switch off the car while it’s driving along? Probably not. So it needs to understand how rational and sensible the person is. The more rational the person, the more willing you are to be switched off. If the person is completely random or even malicious, then you’re less willing to be switched off.<br><br>CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say, I really, really hope you figure this out for us. Thank you so much for that talk. That was amazing.<br><br>SR: Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

They built the body.<br><br>So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.<br><br>We&#39;re working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego.<br><br>They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you&#39;re making.<br><br>It also recognizes where you&#39;re looking, your head orientation.<br><br>We&#39;re emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine.<br><br>And here is a little bit of the technology that&#39;s involved in that.<br><br>In fact, right now – plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let&#39;s see if it gets my facial expressions.<br><br>Okay. So I&#39;m smiling.<br><br>(Laughter) Now I&#39;m frowning.<br><br>And this is really heavily backlit.<br><br>Okay, here we go.<br><br>Oh, it&#39;s so sad.<br><br>Okay, so you smile, frowning.<br><br>So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.<br><br>Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right?<br><br>Those machines have no place for empathy.<br><br>And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.<br><br>Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy.<br><br>So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.<br><br>So, we&#39;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.<br><br>And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.<br><br>This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.<br><br>And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.<br><br>So, we&#39;re involving two things.<br><br>One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it&#39;s more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.<br><br>You start to believe that it&#39;s alive and aware.<br><br>So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;<br><br>which was the basis of the movie &quot;Bladerunner.&quot;<br><br>In these stories, robots often think that they&#39;re human, and they sort of come to life.<br><br>So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.<br><br>And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.<br><br>And this is one of the most exciting projects that we&#39;re developing, which is a little character that&#39;s a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.<br><br>And we&#39;re getting this mass-manufactured.<br><br>We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.<br><br>Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.<br><br>As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.<br><br>Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That&#39;s incredible.<br><br>(Applause)  </div> ]]></content>

How are you?<br><br>(Laughter) It&#39;s been great, hasn&#39;t it?<br><br>I&#39;ve been blown away by the whole thing.<br><br>In fact, I&#39;m leaving.<br><br>(Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about.<br><br>One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we&#39;ve had and in all of the people here.<br><br>Just the variety of it and the range of it.<br><br>The second is that it&#39;s put us in a place where we have no idea what&#39;s going to happen, in terms of the future.<br><br>No idea how this may play out.<br><br>I have an interest in education.<br><br>Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.<br><br>Don&#39;t you?<br><br>I find this very interesting.<br><br>If you&#39;re at a dinner party, and you say you work in education – Actually, you&#39;re not often at dinner parties, frankly.<br><br>(Laughter) If you work in education, you&#39;re not asked.<br><br>(Laughter) And you&#39;re never asked back, curiously.<br><br>That&#39;s strange to me.<br><br>But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, &quot;What do you do?&quot;<br><br>and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face.<br><br>They&#39;re like, &quot;Oh my God,&quot; you know, &quot;Why me?&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;My one night out all week.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall.<br><br>Because it&#39;s one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?<br><br>Like religion, and money and other things.<br><br>So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.<br><br>We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it&#39;s education that&#39;s meant to take us into this future that we can&#39;t grasp.<br><br>If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.<br><br>Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that&#39;s been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years&#39; time.<br><br>And yet we&#39;re meant to be educating them for it.<br><br>So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.<br><br>And the third part of this is that we&#39;ve all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have – their capacities for innovation.<br><br>I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn&#39;t she?<br><br>Just seeing what she could do.<br><br>And she&#39;s exceptional, but I think she&#39;s not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood.<br><br>What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent.<br><br>And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents.<br><br>And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.<br><br>So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.<br><br>My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.<br><br>(Applause) Thank you.<br><br>(Applause) That was it, by the way.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>(Laughter) So, 15 minutes left.<br><br>(Laughter) Well, I was born… no.<br><br>(Laughter) I heard a great story recently – I love telling it – of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.<br><br>She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did.<br><br>The teacher was fascinated.<br><br>She went over to her, and she said, &quot;What are you drawing?&quot;<br><br>And the girl said, &quot;I&#39;m drawing a picture of God.&quot;<br><br>And the teacher said, &quot;But nobody knows what God looks like.&quot;<br><br>And the girl said, &quot;They will, in a minute.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) When my son was four in England – Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.<br><br>(Laughter) If we&#39;re being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.<br><br>He was in the Nativity play.<br><br>Do you remember the story?<br><br>(Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story.<br><br>Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;Nativity II.&quot;<br><br>But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.<br><br>We considered this to be one of the lead parts.<br><br>We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: &quot;James Robinson IS Joseph!&quot; (Laughter) He didn&#39;t have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in?<br><br>They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.<br><br>This really happened.<br><br>We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, &quot;You OK with that?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yeah, why? Was that wrong?&quot;<br><br>They just switched.<br><br>The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, &quot;I bring you gold.&quot;<br><br>And the second boy said, &quot;I bring you myrrh.&quot;<br><br>And the third boy said, &quot;Frank sent this.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.<br><br>If they don&#39;t know, they&#39;ll have a go.<br><br>Am I right? They&#39;re not frightened of being wrong.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.<br><br>What we do know is, if you&#39;re not prepared to be wrong, you&#39;ll never come up with anything original – if you&#39;re not prepared to be wrong.<br><br>And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.<br><br>They have become frightened of being wrong.<br><br>And we run our companies like this.<br><br>We stigmatize mistakes.<br><br>And we&#39;re now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.<br><br>And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.<br><br>Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.<br><br>The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.<br><br>I believe this passionately, that we don&#39;t grow into creativity, we grow out of it.<br><br>Or rather, we get educated out of it.<br><br>So why is this?<br><br>I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.<br><br>In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.<br><br>So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.<br><br>(Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare&#39;s father was born.<br><br>Are you struck by a new thought? I was.<br><br>You don&#39;t think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?<br><br>Do you? Because you don&#39;t think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?<br><br>Shakespeare being seven?<br><br>I never thought of it.<br><br>I mean, he was seven at some point.<br><br>He was in somebody&#39;s English class, wasn&#39;t he?<br><br>(Laughter) How annoying would that be?<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;Must try harder.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, &quot;Go to bed, now!<br><br>And put the pencil down.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;And stop speaking like that.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;It&#39;s confusing everybody.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition.<br><br>My son didn&#39;t want to come.<br><br>I&#39;ve got two kids; he&#39;s 21 now, my daughter&#39;s 16.<br><br>He didn&#39;t want to come to Los Angeles.<br><br>He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.<br><br>This was the love of his life, Sarah.<br><br>He&#39;d known her for a month.<br><br>(Laughter) Mind you, they&#39;d had their fourth anniversary, because it&#39;s a long time when you&#39;re 16.<br><br>He was really upset on the plane, he said, &quot;I&#39;ll never find another girl like Sarah.&quot;<br><br>And we were rather pleased about that, frankly – (Laughter) Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.<br><br>(Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.<br><br>Every one. Doesn&#39;t matter where you go.<br><br>You&#39;d think it would be otherwise, but it isn&#39;t.<br><br>At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts.<br><br>Everywhere on Earth.<br><br>And in pretty much every system too, there&#39;s a hierarchy within the arts.<br><br>Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance.<br><br>There isn&#39;t an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why?<br><br>Why not? I think this is rather important.<br><br>I think math is very important, but so is dance.<br><br>Children dance all the time if they&#39;re allowed to, we all do.<br><br>We all have bodies, don&#39;t we?<br><br>Did I miss a meeting?<br><br>(Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up.<br><br>And then we focus on their heads.<br><br>And slightly to one side.<br><br>If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say &quot;What&#39;s it for, public education?&quot;<br><br>I think you&#39;d have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners – I think you&#39;d have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors.<br><br>Isn&#39;t it?<br><br>They&#39;re the people who come out the top.<br><br>And I used to be one, so there.<br><br>(Laughter) And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn&#39;t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement.<br><br>They&#39;re just a form of life, another form of life.<br><br>But they&#39;re rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them.<br><br>There&#39;s something curious about professors in my experience – not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads.<br><br>They live up there, and slightly to one side.<br><br>They&#39;re disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.<br><br>They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.<br><br>(Laughter) Don&#39;t they?<br><br>It&#39;s a way of getting their head to meetings.<br><br>(Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.<br><br>(Laughter) And there, you will see it.<br><br>Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.<br><br>(Laughter) Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.<br><br>(Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability.<br><br>And there&#39;s a reason.<br><br>Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century.<br><br>They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.<br><br>So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.<br><br>Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top.<br><br>So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right?<br><br>Don&#39;t do music, you&#39;re not going to be a musician; don&#39;t do art, you won&#39;t be an artist.<br><br>Benign advice – now, profoundly mistaken.<br><br>The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.<br><br>And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image.<br><br>If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance.<br><br>And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they&#39;re not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn&#39;t valued, or was actually stigmatized.<br><br>And I think we can&#39;t afford to go on that way.<br><br>In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history.<br><br>More people, and it&#39;s the combination of all the things we&#39;ve talked about – technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.<br><br>Suddenly, degrees aren&#39;t worth anything.<br><br>Isn&#39;t that true?<br><br>When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job.<br><br>If you didn&#39;t have a job, it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t want one.<br><br>And I didn&#39;t want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other.<br><br>It&#39;s a process of academic inflation.<br><br>And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet.<br><br>We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.<br><br>We know three things about intelligence.<br><br>One, it&#39;s diverse.<br><br>We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it.<br><br>We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically.<br><br>We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.<br><br>Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.<br><br>If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive.<br><br>The brain isn&#39;t divided into compartments.<br><br>In fact, creativity – which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value – more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.<br><br>By the way, there&#39;s a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum.<br><br>It&#39;s thicker in women.<br><br>Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking.<br><br>Because you are, aren&#39;t you?<br><br>There&#39;s a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life.<br><br>If my wife is cooking a meal at home – which is not often, thankfully.<br><br>(Laughter) No, she&#39;s good at some things, but if she&#39;s cooking, she&#39;s dealing with people on the phone, she&#39;s talking to the kids, she&#39;s painting the ceiling, she&#39;s doing open-heart surgery over here.<br><br>If I&#39;m cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone&#39;s on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed.<br><br>I say, &quot;Terry, please, I&#39;m trying to fry an egg in here.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;Give me a break.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen?<br><br>Remember that old chestnut?<br><br>I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, &quot;If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it&#39;s distinct.<br><br>I&#39;m doing a new book at the moment called &quot;Epiphany,&quot; which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent.<br><br>I&#39;m fascinated by how people got to be there.<br><br>It&#39;s really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.<br><br>Have you heard of her? Some have.<br><br>She&#39;s a choreographer, and everybody knows her work.<br><br>She did &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera.&quot;<br><br>She&#39;s wonderful.<br><br>I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.<br><br>Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, &quot;How did you get to be a dancer?&quot;<br><br>It was interesting.<br><br>When she was at school, she was really hopeless.<br><br>And the school, in the &#39;30s, wrote to her parents and said, &quot;We think Gillian has a learning disorder.&quot;<br><br>She couldn&#39;t concentrate; she was fidgeting.<br><br>I think now they&#39;d say she had ADHD.<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t you?<br><br>But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn&#39;t been invented at this point.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t an available condition.<br><br>(Laughter) People weren&#39;t aware they could have that.<br><br>(Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist.<br><br>So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school.<br><br>Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight.<br><br>In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, &quot;I&#39;ve listened to all these things your mother&#39;s told me, I need to speak to her privately.<br><br>Wait here. We&#39;ll be back; we won&#39;t be very long,&quot; and they went and left her.<br><br>But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk.<br><br>And when they got out, he said to her mother, &quot;Just stand and watch her.&quot;<br><br>And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music.<br><br>And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, &quot;Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn&#39;t sick; she&#39;s a dancer.<br><br>Take her to a dance school.&quot;<br><br>I said, &quot;What happened?&quot;<br><br>She said, &quot;She did. I can&#39;t tell you how wonderful it was.<br><br>We walked in this room and it was full of people like me.<br><br>People who couldn&#39;t sit still.<br><br>People who had to move to think.&quot;<br><br>Who had to move to think.<br><br>They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary.<br><br>She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.<br><br>She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber.<br><br>She&#39;s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she&#39;s given pleasure to millions, and she&#39;s a multi-millionaire.<br><br>Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.<br><br>(Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson.<br><br>I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity.<br><br>Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity.<br><br>And for the future, it won&#39;t serve us.<br><br>We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we&#39;re educating our children.<br><br>There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, &quot;If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end.<br><br>If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish.&quot;<br><br>And he&#39;s right.<br><br>What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination.<br><br>We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we&#39;ve talked about.<br><br>And the only way we&#39;ll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are.<br><br>And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future.<br><br>By the way – we may not see this future, but they will.<br><br>And our job is to help them make something of it.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

Thumbs down.<br><br>Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.<br><br>Dreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing – thank you, these are great answers, but they&#39;re answers to a different question.<br><br>You guys are answering the question: How does it feel to realize you&#39;re wrong?<br><br>(Laughter) Realizing you&#39;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?<br><br>I mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory, it can actually be quite funny, like my stupid Chinese character mistake.<br><br>But just being wrong doesn&#39;t feel like anything.<br><br>I&#39;ll give you an analogy.<br><br>Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there&#39;s this pathetic coyote who&#39;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?<br><br>In pretty much every episode of this cartoon, there&#39;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff, which is fine – he&#39;s a bird, he can fly.<br><br>But the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.<br><br>And what&#39;s funny – at least if you&#39;re six years old – is that the coyote&#39;s totally fine too.<br><br>He just keeps running – right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he&#39;s in mid-air.<br><br>That&#39;s when he falls.<br><br>When we&#39;re wrong about something – not when we realize it, but before that – we&#39;re like that coyote after he&#39;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down.<br><br>You know, we&#39;re already wrong, we&#39;re already in trouble, but we feel like we&#39;re on solid ground.<br><br>So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.<br><br>It does feel like something to be wrong; it feels like being right.<br><br>(Laughter) So this is one reason, a structural reason, why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.<br><br>I call this error blindness.<br><br>Most of the time, we don&#39;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we&#39;re wrong about something, until it&#39;s too late.<br><br>But there&#39;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well – and this one is cultural.<br><br>Think back for a moment to elementary school.<br><br>You&#39;re sitting there in class, and your teacher is handing back quiz papers, and one of them looks like this.<br><br>This is not mine, by the way.<br><br>(Laughter) So there you are in grade school, and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper.<br><br>It&#39;s the dumb kid, the troublemaker, the one who never does his homework.<br><br>So by the time you are nine years old, you&#39;ve already learned, first of all, that people who get stuff wrong are lazy, irresponsible dimwits – and second of all, that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes.<br><br>We learn these really bad lessons really well.<br><br>And a lot of us – and I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room – deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students, perfectionists, over-achievers.<br><br>Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?<br><br>(Laughter) You&#39;re all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.<br><br>Okay, so fine.<br><br>Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we&#39;ve gotten something wrong.<br><br>Because according to this, getting something wrong means there&#39;s something wrong with us.<br><br>So we just insist that we&#39;re right, because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe.<br><br>So let me tell you a story.<br><br>A couple of years ago, a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.<br><br>Beth Israel&#39;s in Boston.<br><br>It&#39;s the teaching hospital for Harvard – one of the best hospitals in the country.<br><br>So this woman comes in and she&#39;s taken into the operating room.<br><br>She&#39;s anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing – stitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.<br><br>Everything seems to have gone fine.<br><br>And she wakes up, and she looks down at herself, and she says, &quot;Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?&quot;<br><br>Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one.<br><br>When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident, he said something very interesting.<br><br>He said, &quot;For whatever reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous.<br><br>This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world.<br><br>And when we act like it is, and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong, well that&#39;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or torpedoing the global economy.<br><br>So this is a huge practical problem.<br><br>But it&#39;s also a huge social problem.<br><br>Think for a moment about what it means to feel right.<br><br>It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality.<br><br>And when you feel that way, you&#39;ve got a problem to solve, which is, how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you?<br><br>It turns out, most of us explain those people the same way, by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.<br><br>The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they&#39;re ignorant.<br><br>They don&#39;t have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they&#39;re going to see the light and come on over to our team.<br><br>When that doesn&#39;t work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they&#39;re idiots.<br><br>(Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.<br><br>And when that doesn&#39;t work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.<br><br>So this is a catastrophe.<br><br>This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly.<br><br>But to me, what&#39;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human.<br><br>It&#39;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.<br><br>And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.<br><br>That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.<br><br>The miracle of your mind isn&#39;t that you can see the world as it is.<br><br>It&#39;s that you can see the world as it isn&#39;t.<br><br>We can remember the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what it&#39;s like to be some other person in some other place.<br><br>And we all do this a little differently, which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this.<br><br>And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.<br><br>1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot;I think therefore I am,&quot; this guy, St. Augustine, sat down and wrote &quot;Fallor ergo sum&quot; – &quot;I err therefore I am.&quot;<br><br>Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up, it&#39;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system, something we can eradicate or overcome.<br><br>It&#39;s totally fundamental to who we are.<br><br>Because, unlike God, we don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on out there.<br><br>And unlike all of the other animals, we are obsessed with trying to figure it out.<br><br>To me, this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity.<br><br>Last year, for various reasons, I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life.<br><br>And so I&#39;m listening and I&#39;m listening, and at some point, I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong.<br><br>And my first thought was, &quot;I&#39;ve lost it.<br><br>I&#39;ve become the crazy wrongness lady.<br><br>I just imagined it everywhere,&quot; which has happened.<br><br>But a couple of months later, I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who&#39;s the host of the show.<br><br>And I mentioned this to him, and he was like, &quot;No actually, that&#39;s true.<br><br>In fact,&quot; he says, &quot;as a staff, we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme.<br><br>And the crypto-theme is: &#39;I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead.&#39; And the thing is,&quot; says Ira Glass, &quot;we need this.<br><br>We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work.&quot;<br><br>And for the rest of us, audience members, as listeners, as readers, we eat this stuff up.<br><br>We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings.<br><br>When it comes to our stories, we love being wrong.<br><br>But, you know, our stories are like this because our lives are like this.<br><br>We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead.<br><br>George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq, find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction, liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.<br><br>And something else happened instead.<br><br>And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life, until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son.<br><br>And something else happened instead.<br><br>And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.<br><br>And something else happened instead.<br><br>And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize.<br><br>And something else happened instead.<br><br>(Laughter) I mean, this is life.<br><br>For good and for ill, we generate these incredible stories about the world around us, and then the world turns around and astonishes us.<br><br>No offense, but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong.<br><br>We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements, but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements?<br><br>Because half the stuff that&#39;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering – TED 1998 – eh.<br><br>(Laughter) Didn&#39;t really work out that way, did it?<br><br>(Laughter) Where&#39;s my jet pack, Chris?<br><br>(Laughter) (Applause) So here we are again.<br><br>And that&#39;s how it goes.<br><br>We come up with another idea.<br><br>We tell another story.<br><br>We hold another conference.<br><br>The theme of this one, as you guys have now heard seven million times, is the rediscovery of wonder.<br><br>And to me, if you really want to rediscover wonder, you need to step outside of that tiny, terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say, &quot;Wow, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m wrong.&quot;<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>(Applause) Thank you guys.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

It’s great to have you here.<br><br>Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.<br><br>CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we’re going to spend some time exploring your vision for what an exciting future might look like, which I guess makes the first question a little ironic: Why are you boring?<br><br>EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We’re trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic. It affects people in every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It’s horrible. It’s particularly horrible in LA.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: I think you’ve brought with you the first visualization that’s been shown of this. Can I show this?<br><br>EM: Yeah, absolutely. So this is the first time – Just to show what we’re talking about. So a couple of key things that are important in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate, that’s on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance and exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There’s no speed limit here, so we’re designing this to be able to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.<br><br>CA: How much?<br><br>EM: 200 kilometers an hour, or about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able to get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes – five, six minutes.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: So possibly, initially done, it’s like on a sort of toll road-type basis.<br><br>EM: Yeah.<br><br>CA: Which, I guess, alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well.<br><br>EM: So, I don’t know if people noticed it in the video, but there’s no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep than you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion, it will get used up, and then you’ll be back where you started, back with congestion. But you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels.<br><br>CA: But people – seen traditionally, it’s incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea.<br><br>EM: Yeah. Well, they’re right. To give you an example, the LA subway extension, which is – I think it’s a two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars. So it’s roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest utility subway in the world. So yeah, it’s quite difficult to dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling.<br><br>CA: And how could you achieve that?<br><br>EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel according to regulations has to be 26 feet, maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation for combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter to what we’re attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty to get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area by a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales with the cross-sectional area. So that’s roughly a half-order of magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel for half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing, that will give you a factor of two improvement. Combine that and that’s a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being at their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially. I think you can get at least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that. So I think there’s a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is – we’ve got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail from “South Park,” I mean, sorry, “SpongeBob SquarePants.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So Gary is capable of – currently he’s capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: You want to beat Gary.<br><br>EM: We want to beat Gary.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>He’s not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory. Victory is beating the snail.<br><br>CA: But a lot of people imagining, dreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn’t that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost.<br><br>EM: Right. I’m in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets, so I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias against flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they’ll be quite noisy, the wind force generated will be very high. Let’s just say that if something’s flying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>You don’t think to yourself, “Well, I feel better about today.” You’re thinking, “Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off and guillotine me?” Things like that.<br><br>CA: So you’ve got this vision of future cities with these rich, 3D networks of tunnels underneath. Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels to use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago.<br><br>EM: Yeah, so we’ve been sort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative ideas in transport. And it actually ends up being the biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that, but it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might – so we’ve built a little pusher car to push the student pods, but we’re going to try seeing how fast we can make the pusher go if it’s not pushing something. So we’re cautiously optimistic we’ll be able to be faster than the world’s fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch.<br><br>CA: Whoa. Good brakes.<br><br>EM: Yeah, I mean, it’s – yeah. It’s either going to smash into tiny pieces or go quite fast.<br><br>CA: But you can picture, then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances.<br><br>EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that in order to make a tunnel, you have to – In order to seal against the water table, you’ve got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out that automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table, it is automatically capable of holding vacuum.<br><br>CA: Huh.<br><br>EM: So, yeah.<br><br>CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel is in Elon’s future to running Hyperloop?<br><br>EM: I think there’s no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you’d probably want to go underground the entire way because it’s a high-density area. You’re going under a lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think, well, it’s going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able to detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you’re able to detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money for that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect tunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument, you might be able to detect it.<br><br>CA: So you’ve started a new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>EM: What’s funny about that?<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: How much of your time is this?<br><br>EM: It’s maybe … two or three percent.<br><br>CA: You’ve bought a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk hobby looks like.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>EM: I mean, it really is, like – This is basically interns and people doing it part time. We bought some second-hand machinery. It’s kind of puttering along, but it’s making good progress, so –<br><br>CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying cars and transport through Tesla. Is one of the motivations for the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric and where they’re self-driving, there may end up being more cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now?<br><br>EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think that when you make cars autonomous, they’ll be able to go faster and that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy where it’s much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car will be better than that of a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse.<br><br>CA: You started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world that electrification was the future of cars, and a few years ago, people were laughing at you. Now, not so much.<br><br>EM: OK.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>I don’t know. I don’t know.<br><br>CA: But isn’t it true that pretty much every auto manufacturer has announced serious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future?<br><br>EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program. They vary in seriousness. Some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it. And some, amazingly, are still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won’t last much longer.<br><br>CA: But isn’t there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory and say, you know, “We did it.” Let the world electrify, and you go on and focus on other stuff?<br><br>EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla as far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of exciting things that we have coming. Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon. We’ll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.<br><br>CA: OK, we’re going to come to this. So Model 3, it’s supposed to be coming in July-ish.<br><br>EM: Yeah, it’s looking quite good for starting production in July.<br><br>CA: Wow. One of the things that people are so excited about is the fact that it’s got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology would look like.<br><br>EM: Yeah.<br><br>CA: There’s obviously autopilot in Model S right now. What are we seeing here?<br><br>EM: Yeah, so this is using only cameras and GPS. So there’s no LIDAR or radar being used here. This is just using passive optical, which is essentially what a person uses. The whole road system is meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don’t solve vision, it’s not solved. So that’s why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net that’s very effective for road conditions.<br><br>CA: Right. Many other people are going the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most of it.<br><br>EM: You can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it ten times better than humans would, just cameras.<br><br>CA: So the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them. They can’t yet do what that showed. When will they be able to?<br><br>EM: I think we’re still on track for being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end of the year, fully autonomous.<br><br>CA: OK, so by the end of the year, you’re saying, someone’s going to sit in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel, tap in “New York,” off it goes.<br><br>EM: Yeah.<br><br>CA: Won’t ever have to touch the wheel – by the end of 2017.<br><br>EM: Yeah. Essentially, November or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point during the entire journey.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you’ve already got a fleet of Teslas driving all these roads. You’re accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system.<br><br>EM: Yes, but the thing that will be interesting is that I’m actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it’s fairly easy – If you say I’m going to be really good at one specific route, that’s one thing, but it should be able to go, really be very good, certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country. So it’s not sort of limited to LA to New York. We could change it and make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time. So you were going from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto.<br><br>CA: So leaving aside regulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone, the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they’ve arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely?<br><br>EM: I think that’s about two years. So the real trick of it is not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashes one in a thousand times, then you’re probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep. You shouldn’t be, certainly.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>It’s never going to be perfect. No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it’s perhaps – the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow, if I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely never experience a crash, then that’s probably OK.<br><br>CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually get seduced too early to think that this is safe, and that you’ll have some horrible incident happen that puts things back.<br><br>EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances. The thing to appreciate about vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there’s some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accident that is their fault. It’s never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy need to be than a person before you can rely on it?<br><br>CA: But once you get literally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive, because at that point you’ve spoken of people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work, and then you let it go and provide a sort of Uber-like service to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free. Is that really likely?<br><br>EM: Yeah. Absolutely this is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose to use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used only by friends and family, only by other drivers who are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes but not other times. That’s 100 percent what will occur. It’s just a question of when.<br><br>CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you’re planning to announce this in September, but I’m curious whether there’s anything you could show us today?<br><br>EM: I will show you a teaser shot of the truck.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>It’s alive.<br><br>CA: OK.<br><br>EM: That’s definitely a case where we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: We can’t see that much of it, but it doesn’t look like just a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kind of badass. What sort of semi is this?<br><br>EM: So this is a heavy duty, long-range semitruck. So it’s the highest weight capability and with long range. So essentially it’s meant to alleviate the heavy-duty trucking loads. And this is something which people do not today think is possible. They think the truck doesn’t have enough power or it doesn’t have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi. And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: That’s pretty cool. And short term, these aren’t driverless. These are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive.<br><br>EM: Yes. So what will be really fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve with an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car, you’ve got a torque RPM curve that looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this around like a sports car. There’s no gears. It’s, like, single speed.<br><br>CA: There’s a great movie to be made here somewhere. I don’t know what it is and I don’t know that it ends well, but it’s a great movie.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>EM: It’s quite bizarre test-driving. When I was driving the test prototype for the first truck. It’s really weird, because you’re driving around and you’re just so nimble, and you’re in this giant truck.<br><br>CA: Wait, you’ve already driven a prototype?<br><br>EM: Yeah, I drove it around the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy.<br><br>CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.<br><br>EM: It’s just like, driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers.<br><br>CA: This is cool. OK, from a really badass picture to a kind of less badass picture. This is just a cute house from “Desperate Housewives” or something. What on earth is going on here?<br><br>EM: Well, this illustrates the picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve. You’ve got an electric car in the driveway. If you look in between the electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls stacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof. So that’s an actual solar glass roof.<br><br>CA: OK.<br><br>EM: That’s a picture of a real – well, admittedly, it’s a real fake house. That’s a real fake house.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them basically solar power, the ability to –<br><br>EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust the texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there’s sort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you’re looking at the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell behind it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it from a helicopter, you would be actually able to look through and see that some of the glass tiles have a solar cell behind them and some do not. You can’t tell from street level.<br><br>CA: You put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs super affordable, right? They’re not that much more expensive than just tiling the roof.<br><br>EM: Yeah. We’re very confident that the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity – A solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity. So in other words, this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great, and it will last – We thought about having the warranty be infinity, but then people thought, well, that might sound like were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed and there’s nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: I mean, this is cool. So you’re rolling this out in a couple week’s time, I think, with four different roofing types.<br><br>EM: Yeah, we’re starting off with two, two initially, and the second two will be introduced early next year.<br><br>CA: And what’s the scale of ambition here? How many houses do you believe could end up having this type of roofing?<br><br>EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof. The thing is to consider the time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don’t start replacing all roofs immediately. But eventually, if you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar.<br><br>CA: Is there a mental model thing that people don’t get here that because of the shift in the cost, the economics of solar power, most houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs. If you could capture the power, it could pretty much power all their needs. You could go off-grid, kind of.<br><br>EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is relative to the roof area, but it’s a fair statement to say that most houses in the US have enough roof area to power all the needs of the house.<br><br>CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses is the falling price of lithium-ion batteries, which you’ve made a huge bet on as Tesla. In many ways, that’s almost the core competency. And you’ve decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build the world’s largest manufacturing plant to double the world’s supply of lithium-ion batteries, with this guy. What is this?<br><br>EM: Yeah, so that’s the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory. Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there’s sort of a diamond shape overall, and when it’s fully done, it’ll look like a giant diamond, or that’s the idea behind it, and it’s aligned on true north. It’s a small detail.<br><br>CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours of batteries a year.<br><br>EM: A hundred gigawatt hours. We think probably more, but yeah.<br><br>CA: And they’re actually being produced right now.<br><br>EM: They’re in production already. CA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up?<br><br>EM: That’s the slowed down version.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: How fast does it actually go?<br><br>EM: Well, when it’s running at full speed, you can’t actually see the cells without a strobe light. It’s just blur.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: One of your core ideas, Elon, about what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy. Help us picture this. How many Gigafactories, if you like, does it take to get us there?<br><br>EM: It’s about a hundred, roughly. It’s not 10, it’s not a thousand. Most likely a hundred.<br><br>CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take to move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing. It’s like you’re building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it’s kind of cool that you can picture that project. And you’re planning to do, at Tesla – announce another two this year.<br><br>EM: I think we’ll announce locations for somewhere between two and four Gigafactories later this year. Yeah, probably four.<br><br>CA: Whoa.<br><br>(Applause) No more teasing from you for here? Like – where, continent? You can say no.<br><br>EM: We need to address a global market.<br><br>CA: OK.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>This is cool. I think we should talk for – Actually, double mark it. I’m going to ask you one question about politics, only one. I’m kind of sick of politics, but I do want to ask you this. You’re on a body now giving advice to a guy –<br><br>EM: Who?<br><br>CA: Who has said he doesn’t really believe in climate change, and there’s a lot of people out there who think you shouldn’t be doing that. They’d like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them?<br><br>EM: Well, I think that first of all, I’m just on two advisory councils where the format consists of going around the room and asking people’s opinion on things, and so there’s like a meeting every month or two. That’s the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change, or social issues, I’ve used the meetings I’ve had thus far to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>And if I hadn’t done that, that wasn’t on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen, but at least the words were said.<br><br>CA: OK.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>So let’s talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets that were actually reusable. And you’ve only gone and done it.<br><br>EM: Finally. It took a long time.<br><br>CA: Talk us through this. What are we looking at here?<br><br>EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from very high and fast in space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I think this might have been at sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: So that was a sped-up –<br><br>EM: That was the slowed down version.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: I thought that was the sped-up version. But I mean, that’s amazing, and several of these failed before you finally figured out how to do it, but now you’ve done this, what, five or six times?<br><br>EM: We’re at eight or nine.<br><br>CA: And for the first time, you’ve actually reflown one of the rockets that landed.<br><br>EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again and flew it again, so it’s the first reflight of an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it’s important to appreciate that reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft to Boeing in-between flights.<br><br>CA: Right. So this is allowing you to dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.<br><br>EM: Yeah.<br><br>CA: And you’ve designed this outrageous rocket to do it. Help us understand the scale of this thing.<br><br>EM: Well, visually you can see that’s a person. Yeah, and that’s the vehicle.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that’s like, did I read that, a 40-story skyscraper?<br><br>EM: Probably a little more, yeah. The thrust level of this is really – This configuration is about four times the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.<br><br>CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest rocket humanity ever created before.<br><br>EM: Yeah. Yeah.<br><br>CA: As one does. EM: Yeah.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>In units of 747, a 747 is only about a quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there’s 40 747s. So this would be the thrust equivalent of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.<br><br>CA: And so even with a machine designed to escape Earth’s gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually take a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit.<br><br>EM: Exactly. This can take a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers, maximum cargo on the 747 – this can take it as cargo.<br><br>CA: So based on this, you presented recently this Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what, 30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket.<br><br>EM: I’m hopeful it’s sort of an eight- to 10-year time frame. Aspirationally, that’s our target. Our internal targets are more aggressive, but I think –<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: OK.<br><br>EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison with other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat. The future spaceships will be truly enormous.<br><br>CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people on it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of what you’ve said you’d love to do?<br><br>EM: I think it’s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What’s the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we’re not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it’s incredibly depressing if that’s not the future that we’re going to have.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: People want to position this as an either or, that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn’t be thinking about this. You should be solving what’s here and now. And to be fair, you’ve done a fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that?<br><br>EM: I think there’s – I look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities. It’s like a branching stream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing. I may introduce something new to the probability stream. Sustainable energy will happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla, if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It’s tautological. If you don’t have sustainable energy, it means you have unsustainable energy. Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics will drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value of a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur.<br><br>So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good of a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade, potentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That’s what I consider to be the fundamental aspirational good of Tesla.<br><br>Then there’s becoming a multiplanet species and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable. It’s very important to appreciate this is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future I think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization is definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able to send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only take people to low Earth orbit. Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States could take no one to orbit. So that’s the trend. The trend is like down to nothing. People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it.<br><br>CA: Elon, it almost seems, listening to you and looking at the different things you’ve done, that you’ve got this unique double motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work for humanity’s long-term good. The other is the desire to do something exciting. And often it feels like you feel like you need the one to drive the other. With Tesla, you want to have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy, exciting cars to do it. Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs. We haven’t even spoken about your newest thing, which we don’t have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI, and so you’re going to create this really cool brain-machine interface to give us all infinite memory and telepathy and so forth. And on Mars, it feels like what you’re saying is, yeah, we need to save humanity and have a backup plan, but also we need to inspire humanity, and this is a way to inspire.<br><br>EM: I think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I’m not trying to be anyone’s savior. That is not the – I’m just trying to think about the future and not be sad.<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>CA: Beautiful statement. I think everyone here would agree that it is not – None of this is going to happen inevitably. The fact that in your mind, you dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else would dare dream, or no one else would be capable of dreaming at the level of complexity that you do. The fact that you do that, Elon Musk, is a really remarkable thing. Thank you for helping us all to dream a bit bigger.<br><br>EM: But you’ll tell me if it ever starts getting genuinely insane, right?<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>CA: Thank you, Elon Musk. That was really, really fantastic. That was really fantastic.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

height:400px;"><br>Chris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.<br><br>Your software, Linux, is in millions of computers, it probably powers much of the Internet.<br><br>And I think that there are, like, a billion and a half active Android devices out there.<br><br>Your software is in every single one of them.<br><br>It&#39;s kind of amazing.<br><br>You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.<br><br>That&#39;s what I thought – and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.<br><br>I mean, this is – this is the Linux world headquarters.<br><br>(Laughter) (Applause) Linus Torvalds: It really doesn&#39;t look like much.<br><br>And I have to say, the most interesting part in this picture, that people mostly react to, is the walking desk.<br><br>It is the most interesting part in my office and I&#39;m not actually using it anymore.<br><br>And I think the two things are related.<br><br>The way I work is …<br><br>I want to not have external stimulation.<br><br>You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.<br><br>I&#39;m told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.<br><br>(Laughter) It&#39;s like a calming color, it&#39;s not something that really stimulates you.<br><br>What you can&#39;t see is the computer here, you only see the screen, but the main thing I worry about in my computer is – it doesn&#39;t have to be big and powerful, although I like that – it really has to be completely silent.<br><br>I know people who work for Google and they have their own small data center at home, and I don&#39;t do that.<br><br>My office is the most boring office you&#39;ll ever see.<br><br>And I sit there alone in the quiet.<br><br>If the cat comes up, it sits in my lap.<br><br>And I want to hear the cat purring, not the sound of the fans in the computer.<br><br>CA: So this is astonishing, because working this way, you&#39;re able to run this vast technology empire – it is an empire – so that&#39;s an amazing testament to the power of open source.<br><br>Tell us how you got to understand open source and how it lead to the development of Linux.<br><br>LT: I mean, I still work alone.<br><br>Really – I work alone in my house, often in my bathrobe.<br><br>When a photographer shows up, I dress up, so I have clothes on.<br><br>(Laughter) And that&#39;s how I&#39;ve always worked.<br><br>I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.<br><br>I did not start Linux as a collaborative project.<br><br>I started it as one in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just enjoyed programming.<br><br>So it was about the end of the journey, which, 25 years later, we still have not reached.<br><br>But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.<br><br>And what happened is …<br><br>the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.<br><br>Really, this is more of a, &quot;Wow, look at what I did!&quot;<br><br>And trust me – it was not that great back then.<br><br>I made it publicly available, and it wasn&#39;t even open source at that point.<br><br>At that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention behind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today to improve it.<br><br>It was more like, &quot;Look, I&#39;ve been working on this for half a year, I&#39;d love to have comments.&quot;<br><br>And other people approached me.<br><br>At the University of Helsinki, I had a friend who was one of the open source – it was called mainly &quot;free software&quot; back then – and he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey, you can use these open-source licenses that had been around.<br><br>And I thought about it for a while.<br><br>I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.<br><br>I mean, that&#39;s one of the worries I think most people who start out have, is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?<br><br>And I decided, &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br><br>And – CA: And then at some point, someone contributed some code that you thought, &quot;Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.<br><br>This could actually improve this.&quot;<br><br>LT: It didn&#39;t even start by people contributing code, it was more that people started contributing ideas.<br><br>And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project – and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s true of other things, too, but it&#39;s definitely true in code – is that somebody else takes an interest in your code, looks at it enough to actually give you feedback and give you ideas.<br><br>That was a huge thing for me.<br><br>I was 21 at the time, so I was young, but I had already programmed for half my life, basically.<br><br>And every project before that had been completely personal and it was a revelation when people just started commenting, started giving feedback on your code.<br><br>And even before they started giving code back, that was, I think, one of the big moments where I said, &quot;I love other people!&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong – I&#39;m actually not a people person.<br><br>(Laughter) I don&#39;t really love other people – (Laughter) But I love computers, I love interacting with other people on email, because it kind of gives you that buffer.<br><br>But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.<br><br>And it made it so much more.<br><br>CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off, and you thought, &quot;Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge, not just a personal project that I&#39;m getting nice feedback on, but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world&quot;?<br><br>LT: Not really.<br><br>I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little.<br><br>The big point for me was not being alone and having 10, maybe 100 people being involved – that was a big point.<br><br>Then everything else was very gradual.<br><br>Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal – to me.<br><br>Well, I mean, maybe it is if you&#39;re – (Laughter) If you want to sell your result then it&#39;s a huge deal – don&#39;t get me wrong.<br><br>But if you&#39;re interested in the technology and you&#39;re interested in the project, the big part was getting the community.<br><br>Then the community grew gradually.<br><br>And there&#39;s actually not a single point where I went like, &quot;Wow, that just took off!&quot; because it – I mean – it took a long time, relatively.<br><br>CA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you with massively changing their work.<br><br>And it&#39;s not just Linux, it&#39;s this thing called Git, which is this management system for software development.<br><br>Tell us briefly about that and your role in that.<br><br>LT: So one of the issues we had, and this took a while to start to appear, is when you …<br><br>When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which – I mean, right now we&#39;re in the situation where just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that&#39;s every two months, roughly two or three months.<br><br>Some of those people don&#39;t do a lot.<br><br>There&#39;s a lot of people who make small, small changes.<br><br>But to maintain this, the scale changes how you have to maintain it.<br><br>And we went through a lot of pain.<br><br>And there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.<br><br>CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used, and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it and tried something else that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated.<br><br>CA: (Laughs) LT: And we were in this bad spot, where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate, but in many ways, I was the kind of break point, where I could not scale to the point where I could work with thousands of people.<br><br>So Git is my second big project, which was only created for me to maintain my first big project.<br><br>And this is literally how I work.<br><br>I don&#39;t code for – well, I do code for fun – but I want to code for something meaningful so every single project I&#39;ve ever done has been something I needed and – CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have to work with too many people.<br><br>LT: Absolutely. Yes.<br><br>(Laughter) CA: That&#39;s amazing.<br><br>LT: Yeah.<br><br>(Applause) And yet, you&#39;re the man who&#39;s transformed technology not just once but twice, and we have to try and understand why it is.<br><br>You&#39;ve given us some clues, but …<br><br>Here&#39;s a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik&#39;s Cube.<br><br>You mentioned that you&#39;ve been programming since you were like 10 or 11, half your life.<br><br>Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd, were you the star at school who could do everything?<br><br>What were you like as a kid?<br><br>LT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.<br><br>I mean, I was …<br><br>I was not a people person back then.<br><br>That&#39;s my younger brother.<br><br>I was clearly more interested in the Rubik&#39;s Cube than my younger brother.<br><br>(Laughter) My younger sister, who&#39;s not in the picture, when we had family meetings – and it&#39;s not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins – she would prep me beforehand.<br><br>Like, before I stepped into the room she would say, &quot;OK. That&#39;s so-and-so …&quot;<br><br>Because I was not – I was a geek.<br><br>I was into computers, I was into math, I was into physics.<br><br>I was good at that.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I was particularly exceptional.<br><br>Apparently, my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.<br><br>CA: OK, so let&#39;s go there, because that&#39;s interesting.<br><br>You would not let go.<br><br>So that&#39;s not about being a geek and being smart, that&#39;s about being … stubborn?<br><br>LT: That&#39;s about being stubborn.<br><br>That&#39;s about, like, just starting something and not saying, &quot;OK, I&#39;m done, let&#39;s do something else – Look: shiny!&quot;<br><br>And I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.<br><br>I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.<br><br>And I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley, for the whole time.<br><br>That is unheard of.<br><br>That&#39;s not how Silicon Valley works.<br><br>The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs to kind of mix up the pot.<br><br>And that&#39;s not the kind of person I am.<br><br>CA: But during the actual development of Linux itself, that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people.<br><br>Talk about that a bit.<br><br>Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?<br><br>How would you describe what happened?<br><br>LT: I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s essential.<br><br>Going back to the &quot;I&#39;m not a people person,&quot; – sometimes I&#39;m also …<br><br>shall we say, &quot;myopic&quot; when it comes to other people&#39;s feelings, and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.<br><br>And I&#39;m not proud of that.<br><br>(Applause) But, at the same time, it&#39;s – I get people who tell me that I should be nice.<br><br>And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you&#39;re nice, maybe you should be more aggressive, they see that as me being not nice.<br><br>(Laughter) What I&#39;m trying to say is we are different.<br><br>I&#39;m not a people person; it&#39;s not something I&#39;m particularly proud of, but it&#39;s part of me.<br><br>And one of the things I really like about open source is it really allows different people to work together.<br><br>We don&#39;t have to like each other – and sometimes we really don&#39;t like each other.<br><br>Really – I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.<br><br>But you can, actually, you can find things that – you don&#39;t even agree to disagree, it&#39;s just that you&#39;re interested in really different things.<br><br>And coming back to the point where I said earlier that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work, it turned out, and very quickly turned out, that those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.<br><br>And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing, and they had completely different goals.<br><br>And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.<br><br>But because it was open source they could do it, and it actually works really beautifully together.<br><br>And I actually think it works the same way.<br><br>You need to have the people-people, the communicators, the warm and friendly people who like – (Laughter) really want to hug you and get you into the community.<br><br>But that&#39;s not everybody.<br><br>And that&#39;s not me.<br><br>I care about the technology.<br><br>There are people who care about the UI.<br><br>I can&#39;t do UI to save my life.<br><br>I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI, I&#39;d die there.<br><br>(Laughter) So there&#39;s different kinds of people, and I&#39;m not making excuses, I&#39;m trying to explain.<br><br>CA: Now, when we talked last week, you talked about some other trait that you have, which I found really interesting.<br><br>It&#39;s this idea called taste.<br><br>And I&#39;ve just got a couple of images here.<br><br>I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code, and this one is better taste, which one can immediately see.<br><br>What is the difference between these two?<br><br>LT: So this is – How many people here actually have coded?<br><br>CA: Oh my goodness.<br><br>LT: So I guarantee you, everybody who raised their hand, they have done what&#39;s called a singly-linked list.<br><br>And it&#39;s taught – This, the first not very good taste approach, is basically how it&#39;s taught to be done when you start out coding.<br><br>And you don&#39;t have to understand the code.<br><br>The most interesting part to me is the last if statement.<br><br>Because what happens in a singly-linked list – this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list – and there&#39;s a difference between if it&#39;s the first entry or whether it&#39;s an entry in the middle.<br><br>Because if it&#39;s the first entry, you have to change the pointer to the first entry.<br><br>If it&#39;s in the middle, you have to change the pointer of a previous entry.<br><br>So they&#39;re two completely different cases.<br><br>CA: And that&#39;s better.<br><br>LT: And this is better.<br><br>It does not have the if statement.<br><br>And it doesn&#39;t really matter – I don&#39;t want you understand why it doesn&#39;t have the if statement, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that a special case goes away and becomes the normal case.<br><br>And that&#39;s good code.<br><br>But this is simple code.<br><br>This is CS 101.<br><br>This is not important – although, details are important.<br><br>To me, the sign of people I really want to work with is that they have good taste, which is how …<br><br>I sent you this stupid example that is not relevant because it&#39;s too small.<br><br>Good taste is much bigger than this.<br><br>Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing what&#39;s the right way to do things.<br><br>CA: OK, so we&#39;re putting the pieces together here now.<br><br>You have taste, in a way that&#39;s meaningful to software people.<br><br>You&#39;re – (Laughter) LT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.<br><br>CA: You&#39;re a very smart computer coder, and you&#39;re hellish stubborn.<br><br>But there must be something else.<br><br>I mean, you&#39;ve changed the future.<br><br>You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.<br><br>You&#39;re a visionary, right?<br><br>LT: I&#39;ve actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED for the last two days, because there&#39;s a lot of vision going on, right?<br><br>And I am not a visionary.<br><br>I do not have a five-year plan.<br><br>I&#39;m an engineer.<br><br>And I think it&#39;s really – I mean – I&#39;m perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars and saying, &quot;I want to go there.&quot;<br><br>But I&#39;m looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that&#39;s right in front of me before I fall in.<br><br>This is the kind of person I am.<br><br>(Cheers) (Applause) CA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.<br><br>Who are they and how do you relate to them?<br><br>LT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology, the whole Tesla versus Edison, where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.<br><br>And people love Tesla.<br><br>I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.<br><br>(Laughter) The other person there is Edison, who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian and is – I mean, his most famous quote is, &quot;Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.&quot;<br><br>And I&#39;m in the Edison camp, even if people don&#39;t always like him.<br><br>Because if you actually compare the two, Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days, but who actually changed the world?<br><br>Edison may not have been a nice person, he did a lot of things – he was maybe not so intellectual, not so visionary.<br><br>But I think I&#39;m more of an Edison than a Tesla.<br><br>CA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams – big, bold, audacious dreams.<br><br>You&#39;re really the antidote to that.<br><br>LT: I&#39;m trying to dial it down a bit, yes.<br><br>CA: That&#39;s good.<br><br>(Laughter) We embrace you, we embrace you.<br><br>Companies like Google and many others have made, arguably, like, billions of dollars out of your software.<br><br>Does that piss you off?<br><br>LT: No.<br><br>No, it doesn&#39;t piss me off for several reasons.<br><br>And one of them is, I&#39;m doing fine.<br><br>I&#39;m really doing fine.<br><br>But the other reason is – I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing, Linux would never have been what it is.<br><br>And it&#39;s brought experiences I don&#39;t really enjoy, public talking, but at the same time, this is an experience.<br><br>Trust me.<br><br>So there&#39;s a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man and thinking I did the right choices.<br><br>CA: Is the open source idea – this is, I think we&#39;ll end here – is the open source idea fully realized now in the world, or is there more that it could go, are there more things that it could do?<br><br>LT: So, I&#39;m of two minds there.<br><br>I think one reason open source works so well in code is that at the end of the day, code tends to be somewhat black and white.<br><br>There&#39;s often a fairly good way to decide, this is done correctly and this is not done well.<br><br>Code either works or it doesn&#39;t, which means that there&#39;s less room for arguments.<br><br>And we have arguments despite this, right?<br><br>In many other areas – I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that – and it&#39;s really hard sometimes to say that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas just because the black and white turns into not just gray, but different colors.<br><br>So, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.<br><br>Science was there first.<br><br>But then science ended up being pretty closed, with very expensive journals and some of that going on.<br><br>And open source is making a comeback in science, with things like arXiv and open journals.<br><br>Wikipedia changed the world, too.<br><br>So there are other examples, I&#39;m sure there are more to come.<br><br>CA: But you&#39;re not a visionary, and so it&#39;s not up to you to name them.<br><br>LT: No.<br><br>(Laughter) It&#39;s up to you guys to make them, right?<br><br>CA: Exactly.<br><br>Linus Torvalds, thank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet, thank you for all those Android phones.<br><br>Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.<br><br>LT: Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

old, some well-meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.<br><br>Proudly, I said: &quot;An artist.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, you don&#39;t,&quot; he said, &quot;You can&#39;t make a living being an artist!&quot;<br><br>My little seven-year-old Picasso dreams were crushed.<br><br>But I gathered myself, went off in search of a new dream, eventually settling on being a scientist, perhaps something like the next Albert Einstein.<br><br>(Laughter) I have always loved math and science, later, coding.<br><br>And so I decided to study computer programming in college.<br><br>In my junior year, my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films.<br><br>It was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen.<br><br>I watched these films in wonder, transfixed, fireworks going off in my head, thinking, &quot;That is what I want to do with my life.&quot;<br><br>The idea that all the math, science and code I had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories I connected with, was pure magic for me.<br><br>Just two years later, I started working at the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios.<br><br>It was here I learned how we actually execute those films.<br><br>To create our movies, we create a three-dimensional world inside the computer.<br><br>We start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters, or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest.<br><br>And because it&#39;s a three-dimensional world, we can move a camera around inside that world.<br><br>I was fascinated by all of it.<br><br>But then I got my first taste of lighting.<br><br>Lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world.<br><br>I actually have icons of lights I move around in there.<br><br>Here you can see I&#39;ve added a light, I&#39;m turning on the rough version of lighting in our software, turn on shadows and placing the light.<br><br>As I place a light, I think about what it might look like in real life, but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story.<br><br>So it might look like this at first, but as we adjust this and move that in weeks of work, in rough form it might look like this, and in final form, like this.<br><br>There&#39;s this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it.<br><br>It&#39;s where we go from this to this.<br><br>It&#39;s the moment where all the pieces come together, and suddenly the world comes to life as if it&#39;s an actual place that exists.<br><br>This moment never gets old, especially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist.<br><br>As I learned to light, I learned about using light to help tell story, to set the time of day, to create the mood, to guide the audience&#39;s eye, how to make a character look appealing or stand out in a busy set.<br><br>Did you see WALL-E?<br><br>(Laughter) There he is.<br><br>As you can see, we can create any world that we want inside the computer.<br><br>We can make a world with monsters, with robots that fall in love, we can even make pigs fly.<br><br>(Laughter) While this is an incredible thing, this untethered artistic freedom, it can create chaos.<br><br>It can create unbelievable worlds, unbelievable movement, things that are jarring to the audience.<br><br>So to combat this, we tether ourselves with science.<br><br>We use science and the world we know as a backbone, to ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable.<br><br>&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is an excellent example of this.<br><br>A major portion of the movie takes place underwater.<br><br>But how do you make it look underwater?<br><br>In early research and development, we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer.<br><br>Then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look.<br><br>One of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water.<br><br>So we coded up a light that mimics this physics – first, the visibility of the water, and then what happens with the color.<br><br>Objects close to the eye have their full, rich colors.<br><br>As light travels deeper into the water, we lose the red wavelengths, then the green wavelengths, leaving us with blue at the far depths.<br><br>In this clip you can see two other important elements.<br><br>The first is the surge and swell, or the invisible underwater current that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water.<br><br>The second is the caustics.<br><br>These are the ribbons of light, like you might see on the bottom of a pool, that are created when the sun bends through the crests of the ripples and waves on the ocean&#39;s surface.<br><br>Here we have the fog beams.<br><br>These give us color depth cues, but also tells which direction is up in shots where we don&#39;t see the water surface.<br><br>The other really cool thing you can see here is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics, so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light, it appears and disappears, lending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater.<br><br>You can see how we&#39;re using the science – the physics of water, light and movement – to tether that artistic freedom.<br><br>But we are not beholden to it.<br><br>We considered each of these elements and which ones had to be scientifically accurate and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood.<br><br>We realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with.<br><br>So here&#39;s a traditionally colored underwater scene.<br><br>But here, we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green to suit the sad mood of what&#39;s happening.<br><br>In this scene, it&#39;s really important we see deep into the underwater, so we understand what the East Australian Current is, that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride.<br><br>So we pushed the visibility of the water well past anything you would ever see in real life.<br><br>Because in the end, we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world, we&#39;re trying to create a believable world, one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story.<br><br>We use science to create something wonderful.<br><br>We use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder.<br><br>This guy, WALL-E, is a great example of that.<br><br>He finds beauty in the simplest things.<br><br>But when he came in to lighting, we knew we had a big problem.<br><br>We got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot, that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect.<br><br>(Laughter) His binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t have a face or even traditional dialogue, for that matter.<br><br>So the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions.<br><br>We started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections.<br><br>He was starting to look glassy-eyed.<br><br>(Laughter) Now, glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing when you are trying to convince an audience that a robot has a personality and he&#39;s capable of falling in love.<br><br>So we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars, trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials but solve this reflection problem.<br><br>So we started with the lenses.<br><br>Here&#39;s the flat-front lens, we have a concave lens and a convex lens.<br><br>And here you see all three together, showing us all these reflections.<br><br>We tried turning them down, we tried blocking them, nothing was working.<br><br>You can see here, sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes – usually Eve.<br><br>So we couldn&#39;t just use some faked abstract image on the lenses.<br><br>So here we have Eve on the first lens, we put Eve on the second lens, it&#39;s not working.<br><br>We turn it down, it&#39;s still not working.<br><br>And then we have our eureka moment.<br><br>We add a light to WALL-E that accidentally leaks into his eyes.<br><br>You can see it light up these gray aperture blades.<br><br>Suddenly, those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has.<br><br>Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.<br><br>As humans we have the white of our eye, the colored iris and the black pupil.<br><br>Now WALL-E has the black of an eye, the gray aperture blades and the black pupil.<br><br>Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul, like there&#39;s a character with emotion inside.<br><br>Later in the movie towards the end, WALL-E loses his personality, essentially going dead.<br><br>This is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look.<br><br>In the next scene, WALL-E comes back to life.<br><br>We bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back, and he returns to that sweet, soulful robot we&#39;ve come to love.<br><br>(Video) WALL-E: Eva?<br><br>Danielle Feinberg: There&#39;s a beauty in these unexpected moments – when you find the key to unlocking a robot&#39;s soul, the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life.<br><br>The jellyfish in &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was one of those moments for me.<br><br>There are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together.<br><br>This was one of those scenes.<br><br>The director had a vision for this scene based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific.<br><br>As we went along, we were floundering.<br><br>The reviews with the director turned from the normal look-and-feel conversation into more and more questions about numbers and percentages.<br><br>Maybe because unlike normal, we were basing it on something in real life, or maybe just because we had lost our way.<br><br>But it had become about using our brain without our eyes, the science without the art.<br><br>That scientific tether was strangling the scene.<br><br>But even through all the frustrations, I still believed it could be beautiful.<br><br>So when it came in to lighting, I dug in.<br><br>As I worked to balance the blues and the pinks, the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells, the undulating fog beams, something promising began to appear.<br><br>I came in one morning and checked the previous night&#39;s work.<br><br>And I got excited.<br><br>And then I showed it to the lighting director and she got excited.<br><br>Soon, I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people.<br><br>In director review, you hope you might get some nice words, then you get some notes and fixes, generally.<br><br>And then, hopefully, you get a final, signaling to move on to the next stage.<br><br>I gave my intro, and I played the jellyfish scene.<br><br>And the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time.<br><br>Just long enough for me to think, &quot;Oh no, this is doomed.&quot;<br><br>And then he started clapping.<br><br>And then the production designer started clapping.<br><br>And then the whole room was clapping.<br><br>This is the moment that I live for in lighting.<br><br>The moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in.<br><br>We use math, science and code to create these amazing worlds.<br><br>We use storytelling and art to bring them to life.<br><br>It&#39;s this interweaving of art and science that elevates the world to a place of wonder, a place with soul, a place we can believe in, a place where the things you imagine can become real – and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist, but also an artist.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

Rupert Murdoch said to me, &quot;It&#39;s all hard work.<br><br>Nothing comes easily.<br><br>But I have a lot of fun.&quot;<br><br>Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!<br><br>(Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working.<br><br>And they work hard.<br><br>I figured, they&#39;re not workaholics.<br><br>They&#39;re workafrolics.<br><br>(Laughter) Good!<br><br>(Applause) Alex Garden says, &quot;To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it.&quot;<br><br>There&#39;s no magic; it&#39;s practice, practice, practice.<br><br>And it&#39;s focus.<br><br>Norman Jewison said to me, &quot;I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing.&quot;<br><br>And push!<br><br>David Gallo says, &quot;Push yourself.<br><br>Physically, mentally, you&#39;ve got to push, push, push.&quot;<br><br>You&#39;ve got to push through shyness and self-doubt.<br><br>Goldie Hawn says, &quot;I always had self-doubts.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t good enough; I wasn&#39;t smart enough.<br><br>I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it.&quot;<br><br>Now it&#39;s not always easy to push yourself, and that&#39;s why they invented mothers.<br><br>(Laughter) (Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, &quot;My mother pushed me.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) Serve!<br><br>Sherwin Nuland says, &quot;It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.&quot;<br><br>A lot of kids want to be millionaires.<br><br>The first thing I say is: &quot;OK, well you can&#39;t serve yourself; you&#39;ve got to serve others something of value.<br><br>Because that&#39;s the way people really get rich.&quot;<br><br>Ideas!<br><br>TEDster Bill Gates says, &quot;I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d say it was a pretty good idea.<br><br>And there&#39;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas – it&#39;s just doing some very simple things.<br><br>And I give lots of evidence.<br><br>Persist!<br><br>Joe Kraus says, &quot;Persistence is the number one reason for our success.&quot;<br><br>You&#39;ve got to persist through failure.<br><br>You&#39;ve got to persist through crap!<br><br>Which of course means &quot;Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.<br><br>(Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things – and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success.<br><br>Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews!<br><br>(Applause)  </div> ]]></content>

It was a dream that did not happen.<br><br>This year I&#39;m going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.<br><br>This was a perfect introduction.<br><br>And it&#39;s a story that did work. It did happen, and the machines are all around us.<br><br>And it was a technology that was inevitable.<br><br>If the people I&#39;m going to tell you the story about, if they hadn&#39;t done it, somebody else would have.<br><br>So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.<br><br>This is Barricelli&#39;s universe. This is the universe we live in now.<br><br>It&#39;s the universe in which these machines are now doing all these things, including changing biology.<br><br>I&#39;m starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity, which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED: it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.<br><br>And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.<br><br>And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb, he was working on something much more important than bombs: he&#39;s thinking about computers.<br><br>So, he wasn&#39;t only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.<br><br>(Laughter) He built this machine, and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works, with these little bits. And it&#39;s an idea that goes way back.<br><br>The first person to really explain that was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651, explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing, and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic, you can do it all with arithmetic.<br><br>He said you needed addition and subtraction.<br><br>Leibniz, who came a little bit later – this is 1679 – showed that you didn&#39;t even need subtraction.<br><br>You could do the whole thing with addition.<br><br>Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution.<br><br>And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.<br><br>He talked about doing it with marbles, having gates and what we now call shift registers, where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.<br><br>And that&#39;s what all these machines are doing, except, instead of doing it with marbles, they&#39;re doing it with electrons.<br><br>And then we jump to Von Neumann, 1945, when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.<br><br>And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine.<br><br>So June 1945 – actually, the bomb hasn&#39;t even been dropped yet – and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing, which also goes back to Turing, who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this with a very brainless, little, finite state machine, just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.<br><br>The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.<br><br>Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people, giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.<br><br>Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will, but capable of only two ideas.<br><br>(Laughter) And that&#39;s really the simplest computer.<br><br>It&#39;s basically why you need the qubit, because it only has two ideas.<br><br>And you put lots of those together, you get the essentials of the modern computer: the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory, the recording medium, the input and the output.<br><br>But, there&#39;s one catch. This is the fatal – you know, we saw it in starting these programs up.<br><br>The instructions which govern this operation must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.<br><br>So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won&#39;t work.<br><br>If you look at the origins of this, the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.<br><br>But actually, the machine I&#39;m going to tell you about, the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there, really should be down there. So, I&#39;m trying to revise history, and give some of these guys more credit than they&#39;ve had.<br><br>Such a computer would open up universes, which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.<br><br>So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.<br><br>The guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.<br><br>RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time, decided not to go into computers.<br><br>But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA&#39;s offices.<br><br>RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know, televisions are the future, not computers.<br><br>The essentials were all there – all the things that make these machines run.<br><br>Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.<br><br>When RCA said no, that&#39;s when they decided to build it in Princeton, where Freeman works at the Institute.<br><br>That&#39;s where I grew up as a kid.<br><br>That&#39;s me, that&#39;s my sister Esther, who&#39;s talked to you before, so we both go back to the birth of this thing.<br><br>That&#39;s Freeman, a long time ago, and that was me.<br><br>And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern, who wrote the &quot;Theory of Games.&quot;<br><br>All these forces came together there, in Princeton.<br><br>Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.<br><br>The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.<br><br>And Julian Bigelow, who took Zworkykin&#39;s place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics, how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this, and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.<br><br>These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.<br><br>They didn&#39;t fit in at the Institute.<br><br>This is a letter from the director, concerned about – &quot;especially unfair on the matter of sugar.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) You can read the text.<br><br>(Laughter) This is hackers getting in trouble for the first time.<br><br>(Laughter).<br><br>These were not theoretical physicists.<br><br>They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.<br><br>And we take it for granted now, that each of these machines has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.<br><br>They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.<br><br>They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube, because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.<br><br>And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.<br><br>Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned at 15 other places around the world.<br><br>And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.<br><br>All the computers now are copies of that machine.<br><br>The memory was in cathode ray tubes – a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube – very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.<br><br>So, there&#39;s 40 of these tubes, like a V-40 engine running the memory.<br><br>(Laughter) The input and the output was by teletype tape at first.<br><br>This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.<br><br>This is the archetype of the hard disk that&#39;s in your machine now.<br><br>Then they switched to a magnetic drum.<br><br>This is modifying IBM equipment, which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.<br><br>And this is the beginning of computer graphics.<br><br>The &quot;Graph&#39;g-Beam Turn On.&quot; This next slide, that&#39;s the – as far as I know – the first digital bitmap display, 1954.<br><br>So, Von Neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud, doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components.<br><br>Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.<br><br>And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.<br><br>&quot;Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes.&quot;<br><br>This includes a large amount of human error.<br><br>So they are always trying to figure out, what&#39;s machine error? What&#39;s human error?<br><br>What&#39;s code, what&#39;s hardware?<br><br>That&#39;s an engineer gazing at tube number 36, trying to figure out why the memory&#39;s not in focus.<br><br>He had to focus the memory – seems OK.<br><br>So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running, let alone having, you know, software problems.<br><br>&quot;No use, went home.&quot; (Laughter) &quot;Impossible to follow the damn thing, where&#39;s a directory?&quot;<br><br>So, already, they&#39;re complaining about the manuals: &quot;before closing down in disgust … &quot; &quot;The General Arithmetic: Operating Logs.&quot;<br><br>Burning lots of midnight oil.<br><br>&quot;MANIAC,&quot; which became the acronym for the machine, Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, &quot;lost its memory.&quot;<br><br>&quot;MANIAC regained its memory, when the power went off.&quot; &quot;Machine or human?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aha!&quot; So, they figured out it&#39;s a code problem.<br><br>&quot;Found trouble in code, I hope.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Code error, machine not guilty.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Damn it, I can be just as stubborn as this thing.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;And the dawn came.&quot; So they ran all night.<br><br>Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.<br><br>&quot;Everything up to this point is wasted time.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s the use? Good night.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Master control off. The hell with it. Way off.&quot; (Laughter) &quot;Something&#39;s wrong with the air conditioner – smell of burning V-belts in the air.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A short – do not turn the machine on.&quot;<br><br>&quot;IBM machine putting a tar-like substance on the cards. The tar is from the roof.&quot;<br><br>So they really were working under tough conditions.<br><br>(Laughter) Here, &quot;A mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;Here lies mouse. Born: ?. Died: 4:50 a.m., May 1953.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) There&#39;s an inside joke someone has penciled in: &quot;Here lies Marston Mouse.&quot;<br><br>If you&#39;re a mathematician, you get that, because Marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there.<br><br>&quot;Picked a lightning bug off the drum.&quot; &quot;Running at two kilocycles.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s two thousand cycles per second – &quot;yes, I&#39;m chicken&quot; – so two kilocycles was slow speed.<br><br>The high speed was 16 kilocycles.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz, that&#39;s slow speed.<br><br>&quot;I have now duplicated both results.<br><br>How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?<br><br>This now is the third different output.<br><br>I know when I&#39;m licked.&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;We&#39;ve duplicated errors before.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Machine run, fine. Code isn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Only happens when the machine is running.&quot;<br><br>And sometimes things are okay.<br><br>&quot;Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever.&quot; &quot;Perfect running.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Parting thought: when there&#39;s bigger and better errors, we&#39;ll have them.&quot;<br><br>So, nobody was supposed to know they were actually designing bombs.<br><br>They&#39;re designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook, late one night, finally drew a bomb.<br><br>So, that was the result. It was Mike, the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.<br><br>That was designed on that machine, in the woods behind the Institute.<br><br>So Von Neumann invited a whole gang of weirdos from all over the world to work on all these problems.<br><br>Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life, trying to see if, in this artificial universe – he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.<br><br>He&#39;s still ahead of some of the stuff that&#39;s being done now.<br><br>Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.<br><br>Began – his universe started March 3, &#39;53.<br><br>So it&#39;s almost exactly – it&#39;s 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.<br><br>And he saw everything in terms of – he could read the binary code straight off the machine.<br><br>He had a wonderful rapport.<br><br>Other people couldn&#39;t get the machine running. It always worked for him.<br><br>Even errors were duplicated.<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right.&quot;<br><br>So he designed this universe, and ran it.<br><br>When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.<br><br>He would run that thing all night long, running these things, if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram, who reinvented this stuff.<br><br>And he published it. It wasn&#39;t locked up and disappeared.<br><br>It was published in the literature.<br><br>&quot;If it&#39;s that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?&quot;<br><br>So, he decided to give it a try, to start this artificial biology going in the machines.<br><br>And he found all these, sort of – it was like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe, and seeing all these things happening that we see in the outside world, in biology.<br><br>This is some of the generations of his universe.<br><br>But they&#39;re just going to stay numbers; they&#39;re not going to become organisms.<br><br>They have to have something.<br><br>You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.<br><br>They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that, started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with – playing chess with other machines and so on.<br><br>And they did start to evolve.<br><br>And he went around the country after that.<br><br>Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it, and saw exactly what&#39;s happening now.<br><br>That the programs, instead of being turned off – when you quit the program, you&#39;d keep running and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing, running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines, he envisioned all that happening.<br><br>And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t any sort of creator intelligence, but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence.<br><br>And he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was lifelike, or a new kind of life.<br><br>It just was another version of the same thing happening.<br><br>And there&#39;s really no difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago.<br><br>And could you do it again now?<br><br>So, when I went into these archives looking at this stuff, lo and behold, the archivist came up one day, saying, &quot;I think we found another box that had been thrown out.&quot;<br><br>And it was his universe on punch cards.<br><br>So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there – sort of suspended animation.<br><br>That&#39;s the instructions for running – this is actually the source code for one of those universes, with a note from the engineers saying they&#39;re having some problems.<br><br>&quot;There must be something about this code that you haven&#39;t explained yet.&quot;<br><br>And I think that&#39;s really the truth. We still don&#39;t understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.<br><br>What&#39;s the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?<br><br>These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.<br><br>And the question is, should we run them or not?<br><br>You know, could we get them running?<br><br>Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?<br><br>These machines would think they – these organisms, if they came back to life now – whether they&#39;ve died and gone to heaven, there&#39;s a universe.<br><br>My laptop is 10 thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.<br><br>He was thinking far ahead, to how this would really grow into a new kind of life.<br><br>And that&#39;s what&#39;s happening!<br><br>When Juan Enriquez told us about these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth, of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab, that&#39;s what Barricelli imagined: that this digital code in these machines is actually starting to code – it already is coding from nucleic acids.<br><br>We&#39;ve been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR and synthesizing small strings of DNA.<br><br>And real soon, we&#39;re actually going to be synthesizing the proteins, and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.<br><br>It&#39;s a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.<br><br>This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes on self-reproducing machines, what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started to where they begin to reproduce.<br><br>It took really three people: Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing; Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines – that now, last count, four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours; and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago – this is John Markoff&#39;s obituary for him – he was the important missing link, the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.<br><br>And all our computers have, inside them, the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day, sort of on pencil and paper.<br><br>And we owe a tremendous credit to that.<br><br>And he explained, in a very generous way, the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the &#39;40s to do this project, and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions, no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.<br><br>That&#39;s the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down, July 1958.<br><br>And it&#39;s Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off.<br><br>And that&#39;s the end.<br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>(Applause)  </div> ]]></content>

But it’s also a fiction. There’s a lot of work that went into it after that. And what he’s done is he’s actually reshaped, digitally, all of the contours of the mountains to follow the vicissitudes of the Dow Jones index. So what you see, that precipice, that high precipice with the valley, is the 2008 financial crisis. The photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there. I don’t know where we are now. This is the Hang Seng index for Hong Kong. And similar topography. I wonder why.<br><br>And this is art. This is metaphor. But I think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth, and it’s with those teeth that I want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math – not just financial math, but math in general. That its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it – the world around us and the world inside us. And it’s specifically algorithms, which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff. They acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again, and they ossify and calcify, and they become real.<br><br>And I was thinking about this, of all places, on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago, because I happened to be seated next to a Hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the Cold War for physicists in Hungary. And I said, “So what were you doing?”<br><br>And he said, “Well we were mostly breaking stealth.”<br><br>And I said, “That’s a good job. That’s interesting. How does that work?” And to understand that, you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works. And so – this is an over-simplification – but basically, it’s not like you can just pass a radar signal right through 156 tons of steel in the sky. It’s not just going to disappear. But if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things – something like a flock of birds – well then the radar that’s looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky. And if you’re a radar, that’s a really bad job.<br><br>And he said, “Yeah.” He said, “But that’s if you’re a radar. So we didn’t use a radar; we built a black box that was looking for electrical signals, electronic communication. And whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic communication, we thought, ‘Probably has something to do with the Americans.’”<br><br>And I said, “Yeah. That’s good. So you’ve effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research. What’s your act two? What do you do when you grow up?” And he said, “Well, financial services.” And I said, “Oh.” Because those had been in the news lately. And I said, “How does that work?” And he said, “Well there’s 2,000 physicists on Wall Street now, and I’m one of them.” And I said, “What’s the black box for Wall Street?”<br><br>And he said, “It’s funny you ask that, because it’s actually called black box trading. And it’s also sometimes called algo trading, algorithmic trading.” And algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the United States Air Force had, which is that they’re moving these positions – whether it’s Proctor &amp; Gamble or Accenture, whatever – they’re moving a million shares of something through the market. And if they do that all at once, it’s like playing poker and going all in right away. You just tip your hand. And so they have to find a way – and they use algorithms to do this – to break up that big thing into a million little transactions. And the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what’s actually happening in the market.<br><br>So if you need to have some image of what’s happening in the stock market right now, what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide, and a bunch of algorithms that are programmed to go find them and act. And all of that’s great, and it’s fine. And that’s 70 percent of the United States stock market, 70 percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension, your mortgage.<br><br>And what could go wrong? What could go wrong is that a year ago, nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes, and they called it the Flash Crash of 2:45. All of a sudden, nine percent just goes away, and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it, nobody asked for it. Nobody had any control over what was actually happening. All they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that said, “Stop.”<br><br>And that’s the thing, is that we’re writing things, we’re writing these things that we can no longer read. And we’ve rendered something illegible, and we’ve lost the sense of what’s actually happening in this world that we’ve made. And we’re starting to make our way. There’s a company in Boston called Nanex, and they use math and magic and I don’t know what, and they reach into all the market data and they find, actually sometimes, some of these algorithms. And when they find them they pull them out and they pin them to the wall like butterflies. And they do what we’ve always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don’t understand – which is that they give them a name and a story. So this is one that they found, they called the Knife, the Carnival, the Boston Shuffler, Twilight.<br><br>And the gag is that, of course, these aren’t just running through the market. You can find these kinds of things wherever you look, once you learn how to look for them. You can find it here: this book about flies that you may have been looking at on Amazon. You may have noticed it when its price started at 1.7 million dollars. It’s out of print – still … (Laughter) If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain. A few hours later, it had gone up to 23.6 million dollars, plus shipping and handling. And the question is: Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening? And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street. And when you see this kind of behavior, what you see is the evidence of algorithms in conflict, algorithms locked in loops with each other, without any human oversight, without any adult supervision to say, “Actually, 1.7 million is plenty.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And as with Amazon, so it is with Netflix. And so Netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years. They started with Cinematch, and they’ve tried a bunch of others – there’s Dinosaur Planet; there’s Gravity. They’re using Pragmatic Chaos now. Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms, trying to do the same thing. It’s trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next – which is a very, very difficult problem. But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don’t really quite have it down, it doesn’t take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has. Pragmatic Chaos, like all Netflix algorithms, determines, in the end, 60 percent of what movies end up being rented. So one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for 60 percent of those movies.<br><br>But what if you could rate those movies before they get made? Wouldn’t that be handy? Well, a few data scientists from the U.K. are in Hollywood, and they have “story algorithms” – a company called Epagogix. And you can run your script through there, and they can tell you, quantifiably, that that’s a 30 million dollar movie or a 200 million dollar movie. And the thing is, is that this isn’t Google. This isn’t information. These aren’t financial stats; this is culture. And what you see here, or what you don’t really see normally, is that these are the physics of culture. And if these algorithms, like the algorithms on Wall Street, just crashed one day and went awry, how would we know? What would it look like?<br><br>And they’re in your house. They’re in your house. These are two algorithms competing for your living room. These are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means. And you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them, and they’re sort of like secret architects in your bedroom. And the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not far-fetched. It’s super-real and it’s happening around you.<br><br>You feel it most when you’re in a sealed metal box, a new-style elevator; they’re called destination-control elevators. These are the ones where you have to press what floor you’re going to go to before you get in the elevator. And it uses what’s called a bin-packing algorithm. So none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want. Everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two, and everybody who wants to go to the third floor goes into car five. And the problem with that is that people freak out. People panic. And you see why. You see why. It’s because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation, like the buttons. (Laughter) Like the things that people use. All it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that says, “Stop.” And this is what we’re designing for. We’re designing for this machine dialect. And how far can you take that? How far can you take it? You can take it really, really far.<br><br>So let me take it back to Wall Street. Because the algorithms of Wall Street are dependent on one quality above all else, which is speed. And they operate on milliseconds and microseconds. And just to give you a sense of what microseconds are, it takes you 500,000 microseconds just to click a mouse. But if you’re a Wall Street algorithm and you’re five microseconds behind, you’re a loser. So if you were an algorithm, you’d look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper – throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in – all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet.<br><br>And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system. And of course, it is, but it’s distributed from places. In New York, this is where it’s distributed from: the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street. And this is really where the wires come right up into the city. And the reality is that the further away you are from that, you’re a few microseconds behind every time. These guys down on Wall Street, Marco Polo and Cherokee Nation, they’re eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the Carrier Hotel. And that’s going to keep happening. We’re going to keep hollowing them out, because you, inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar, none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the Boston Shuffler could.<br><br>But if you zoom out, if you zoom out, you would see an 825-mile trench between New York City and Chicago that’s been built over the last few years by a company called Spread Networks. This is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal 37 times faster than you can click a mouse – just for these algorithms, just for the Carnival and the Knife. And when you think about this, that we’re running through the United States with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster, all for a communications framework that no human will ever know, that’s a kind of manifest destiny; and we’ll always look for a new frontier.<br><br>Unfortunately, we have our work cut out for us. This is just theoretical. This is some mathematicians at MIT. And the truth is I don’t really understand a lot of what they’re talking about. It involves light cones and quantum entanglement, and I don’t really understand any of that. But I can read this map, and what this map says is that, if you’re trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are, that’s where people are, where the cities are, you’re going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively. And the thing that you might have noticed about those blue dots is that a lot of them are in the middle of the ocean. So that’s what we’ll do: we’ll build bubbles or something, or platforms. We’ll actually part the water to pull money out of the air, because it’s a bright future if you’re an algorithm.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And it’s not the money that’s so interesting actually. It’s what the money motivates, that we’re actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar’s photographs, and you realize that they’re not metaphor, they’re prophecy. They’re prophecy for the kind of seismic, terrestrial effects of the math that we’re making. And the landscape was always made by this sort of weird, uneasy collaboration between nature and man. But now there’s this third co-evolutionary force: algorithms – the Boston Shuffler, the Carnival. And we will have to understand those as nature, and in a way, they are.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;この15分のプログラミングに関するTED Talkでは、Slavinはプログラミングが現代の我々にとって非常に重要である理由を示してくれています。現代のアルゴリズムはあまりにも無謀に書かれています。プログラマとしては、これも考慮しておく必要があるのではないでしょうか。&lt;/p&gt;

I have a brain fan out there.<br><br>(Laughter) If I could have my first slide, you&#39;ll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations.<br><br>So what I&#39;m going to talk about is why we don&#39;t have a good brain theory, why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it.<br><br>I&#39;ll try to do all that in 20 minutes.<br><br>I have two affiliations.<br><br>Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park.<br><br>We study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works.<br><br>I&#39;m going to talk all about that.<br><br>I have one slide on my other life, the computer life, and that&#39;s this slide here.<br><br>These are some of the products I&#39;ve worked on over the last 20 years, starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on, ending up most recently with the Treo, and we&#39;re continuing to do this.<br><br>I&#39;ve done this because I believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing, and I&#39;m trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things.<br><br>But this was, I admit, all an accident.<br><br>I really didn&#39;t want to do any of these products.<br><br>Very early in my career I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry.<br><br>Before that, I just have to tell you about this picture of Graffiti I picked off the web the other day.<br><br>I was looking for a picture for Graffiti that&#39;ll text input language.<br><br>I found a website dedicated to teachers who want to make script-writing things across the top of their blackboard, and they had added Graffiti to it, and I&#39;m sorry about that.<br><br>(Laughter) So what happened was, when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in &#39;79, I went to work for Intel and was in the computer industry, and three months into that, I fell in love with something else.<br><br>I said, &quot;I made the wrong career choice here,&quot; and I fell in love with brains.<br><br>This is not a real brain.<br><br>This is a picture of one, a line drawing.<br><br>And I don&#39;t remember exactly how it happened, but I have one recollection, which was pretty strong in my mind.<br><br>In September of 1979, Scientific American came out with a single-topic issue about the brain.<br><br>It was one of their best issues ever.<br><br>They talked about the neuron, development, disease, vision and all the things you might want to know about brains.<br><br>It was really quite impressive.<br><br>One might&#39;ve had the impression we knew a lot about brains.<br><br>But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame.<br><br>Today is, I think, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA.<br><br>And he wrote a story basically saying, this is all well and good, but you know, we don&#39;t know diddly squat about brains, and no one has a clue how they work, so don&#39;t believe what anyone tells you.<br><br>This is a quote from that article, he says: &quot;What is conspicuously lacking&quot; – he&#39;s a very proper British gentleman – &quot;What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches.&quot;<br><br>I thought the word &quot;framework&quot; was great.<br><br>He didn&#39;t say we didn&#39;t have a theory.<br><br>He says we don&#39;t even know how to begin to think about it.<br><br>We don&#39;t even have a framework.<br><br>We are in the pre-paradigm days, if you want to use Thomas Kuhn.<br><br>So I fell in love with this.<br><br>I said, look: We have all this knowledge about brains – how hard can it be?<br><br>It&#39;s something we can work on in my lifetime; I could make a difference.<br><br>So I tried to get out of the computer business, into the brain business.<br><br>First, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there.<br><br>I said, I want to build intelligent machines too, but I want to study how brains work first.<br><br>And they said, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t need to do that.<br><br>You&#39;re just going to program computers, that&#39;s all.<br><br>I said, you really ought to study brains.<br><br>They said, &quot;No, you&#39;re wrong.&quot;<br><br>I said, &quot;No, you&#39;re wrong,&quot; and I didn&#39;t get in.<br><br>(Laughter) I was a little disappointed – pretty young – but I went back again a few years later, this time in California, and I went to Berkeley.<br><br>And I said, I&#39;ll go in from the biological side.<br><br>So I got in the PhD program in biophysics.<br><br>I was like, I&#39;m studying brains now.<br><br>Well, I want to study theory.<br><br>They said, &quot;You can&#39;t study theory about brains.<br><br>You can&#39;t get funded for that.<br><br>And as a graduate student, you can&#39;t do that.&quot;<br><br>So I said, oh my gosh.<br><br>I was depressed; I said, but I can make a difference in this field.<br><br>I went back in the computer industry and said, I&#39;ll have to work here for a while.<br><br>That&#39;s when I designed all those computer products.<br><br>(Laughter) I said, I want to do this for four years, make some money, I was having a family, and I would mature a bit, and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit.<br><br>Well, it took longer than four years.<br><br>It&#39;s been about 16 years.<br><br>But I&#39;m doing it now, and I&#39;m going to tell you about it.<br><br>So why should we have a good brain theory?<br><br>Well, there&#39;s lots of reasons people do science.<br><br>The most basic one is, people like to know things.<br><br>We&#39;re curious, and we go out and get knowledge.<br><br>Why do we study ants? It&#39;s interesting.<br><br>Maybe we&#39;ll learn something useful, but it&#39;s interesting and fascinating.<br><br>But sometimes a science has other attributes which makes it really interesting.<br><br>Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves; it&#39;ll tell us who we are.<br><br>Evolution did this and Copernicus did this, where we have a new understanding of who we are.<br><br>And after all, we are our brains.<br><br>My brain is talking to your brain.<br><br>Our bodies are hanging along for the ride, but my brain is talking to your brain.<br><br>And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive, we need to understand brains.<br><br>Another thing is sometimes science leads to big societal benefits, technologies, or businesses or whatever.<br><br>This is one, too, because when we understand how brains work, we&#39;ll be able to build intelligent machines.<br><br>That&#39;s a good thing on the whole, with tremendous benefits to society, just like a fundamental technology.<br><br>So why don&#39;t we have a good theory of brains?<br><br>People have been working on it for 100 years.<br><br>Let&#39;s first take a look at what normal science looks like.<br><br>This is normal science.<br><br>Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists.<br><br>The theorist guy says, &quot;I think this is what&#39;s going on,&quot; the experimentalist says, &quot;You&#39;re wrong.&quot;<br><br>It goes back and forth, this works in physics, this in geology.<br><br>But if this is normal science, what does neuroscience look like?<br><br>This is what neuroscience looks like.<br><br>We have this mountain of data, which is anatomy, physiology and behavior.<br><br>You can&#39;t imagine how much detail we know about brains.<br><br>There were 28,000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year, and every one of them is doing research in brains.<br><br>A lot of data, but no theory.<br><br>There&#39;s a little wimpy box on top there.<br><br>And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences.<br><br>And it&#39;s a real shame.<br><br>Now, why has this come about?<br><br>If you ask neuroscientists why is this the state of affairs, first, they&#39;ll admit it.<br><br>But if you ask them, they say, there&#39;s various reasons we don&#39;t have a good brain theory.<br><br>Some say we still don&#39;t have enough data, we need more information, there&#39;s all these things we don&#39;t know.<br><br>Well, I just told you there&#39;s data coming out of your ears.<br><br>We have so much information, we don&#39;t even know how to organize it.<br><br>What good is more going to do?<br><br>Maybe we&#39;ll be lucky and discover some magic thing, but I don&#39;t think so.<br><br>This is a symptom of the fact that we just don&#39;t have a theory.<br><br>We don&#39;t need more data, we need a good theory.<br><br>Another one is sometimes people say, &quot;Brains are so complex, it&#39;ll take another 50 years.&quot;<br><br>I even think Chris said something like this yesterday, something like, it&#39;s one of the most complicated things in the universe.<br><br>That&#39;s not true – you&#39;re more complicated than your brain.<br><br>You&#39;ve got a brain.<br><br>And although the brain looks very complicated, things look complicated until you understand them.<br><br>That&#39;s always been the case.<br><br>So we can say, my neocortex, the part of the brain I&#39;m interested in, has 30 billion cells.<br><br>But, you know what?<br><br>It&#39;s very, very regular.<br><br>In fact, it looks like it&#39;s the same thing repeated over and over again.<br><br>It&#39;s not as complex as it looks.<br><br>That&#39;s not the issue.<br><br>Some people say, brains can&#39;t understand brains.<br><br>Very Zen-like. Woo.<br><br>(Laughter) You know, it sounds good, but why?<br><br>I mean, what&#39;s the point?<br><br>It&#39;s just a bunch of cells.<br><br>You understand your liver.<br><br>It&#39;s got a lot of cells in it too, right?<br><br>So, you know, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to that.<br><br>And finally, some people say, &quot;I don&#39;t feel like a bunch of cells – I&#39;m conscious.<br><br>I&#39;ve got this experience, I&#39;m in the world.<br><br>I can&#39;t be just a bunch of cells.&quot;<br><br>Well, people used to believe there was a life force to be living, and we now know that&#39;s really not true at all.<br><br>And there&#39;s really no evidence, other than that people just disbelieve that cells can do what they do.<br><br>So some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism, some really smart people, too, but we can reject all that.<br><br>(Laughter) No, there&#39;s something else, something really fundamental, and it is: another reason why we don&#39;t have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive, strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer.<br><br>There&#39;s something we believe that just, it&#39;s obvious, but it&#39;s wrong.<br><br>Now, there&#39;s a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is, I&#39;ll tell you about the history of it in science.<br><br>Look at other scientific revolutions – the solar system, that&#39;s Copernicus, Darwin&#39;s evolution, and tectonic plates, that&#39;s Wegener.<br><br>They all have a lot in common with brain science.<br><br>First, they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it.<br><br>But it got more manageable once they had a theory.<br><br>The best minds were stumped – really smart people.<br><br>We&#39;re not smarter now than they were then; it just turns out it&#39;s really hard to think of things, but once you&#39;ve thought of them, it&#39;s easy to understand.<br><br>My daughters understood these three theories, in their basic framework, in kindergarten.<br><br>It&#39;s not that hard – here&#39;s the apple, here&#39;s the orange, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.<br><br>Another thing is the answer was there all along, but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing.<br><br>It was an intuitive, strongly held belief that was wrong.<br><br>In the case of the solar system, the idea that the Earth is spinning, the surface is going a thousand miles an hour, and it&#39;s going through the solar system at a million miles an hour – this is lunacy; we all know the Earth isn&#39;t moving.<br><br>Do you feel like you&#39;re moving a thousand miles an hour?<br><br>If you said Earth was spinning around in space and was huge – they would lock you up, that&#39;s what they did back then.<br><br>So it was intuitive and obvious.<br><br>Now, what about evolution?<br><br>Evolution, same thing.<br><br>We taught our kids the Bible says God created all these species, cats are cats; dogs are dogs; people are people; plants are plants; they don&#39;t change.<br><br>Noah put them on the ark in that order, blah, blah.<br><br>The fact is, if you believe in evolution, we all have a common ancestor.<br><br>We all have a common ancestor with the plant in the lobby!<br><br>This is what evolution tells us.<br><br>And it&#39;s true. It&#39;s kind of unbelievable.<br><br>And the same thing about tectonic plates.<br><br>All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t make any sense.<br><br>So what is the intuitive, but incorrect assumption, that&#39;s kept us from understanding brains?<br><br>I&#39;ll tell you. It&#39;ll seem obvious that it&#39;s correct. That&#39;s the point.<br><br>Then I&#39;ll make an argument why you&#39;re incorrect on the other assumption.<br><br>The intuitive but obvious thing is: somehow, intelligence is defined by behavior; we&#39;re intelligent because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently.<br><br>And I&#39;m going to tell you that&#39;s wrong.<br><br>Intelligence is defined by prediction.<br><br>I&#39;m going to work you through this in a few slides, and give you an example of what this means.<br><br>Here&#39;s a system.<br><br>Engineers and scientists like to look at systems like this.<br><br>They say, we have a thing in a box.<br><br>We have its inputs and outputs.<br><br>The AI people said, the thing in the box is a programmable computer, because it&#39;s equivalent to a brain.<br><br>We&#39;ll feed it some inputs and get it to do something, have some behavior.<br><br>Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which essentially says, we&#39;ll know if something&#39;s intelligent if it behaves identical to a human – a behavioral metric of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds for a long time.<br><br>Reality, though – I call it real intelligence.<br><br>Real intelligence is built on something else.<br><br>We experience the world through a sequence of patterns, and we store them, and we recall them.<br><br>When we recall them, we match them up against reality, and we&#39;re making predictions all the time.<br><br>It&#39;s an internal metric; there&#39;s an internal metric about us, saying, do we understand the world, am I making predictions, and so on.<br><br>You&#39;re all being intelligent now, but you&#39;re not doing anything.<br><br>Maybe you&#39;re scratching yourself, but you&#39;re not doing anything.<br><br>But you&#39;re being intelligent; you&#39;re understanding what I&#39;m saying.<br><br>Because you&#39;re intelligent and you speak English, you know the word at the end of this sentence.<br><br>The word came to you; you make these predictions all the time.<br><br>What I&#39;m saying is, the internal prediction is the output in the neocortex, and somehow, prediction leads to intelligent behavior.<br><br>Here&#39;s how that happens: Let&#39;s start with a non-intelligent brain.<br><br>I&#39;ll argue a non-intelligent brain, we&#39;ll call it an old brain.<br><br>And we&#39;ll say it&#39;s a non-mammal, like a reptile, say, an alligator; we have an alligator.<br><br>And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.<br><br>It&#39;s got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose.<br><br>It has very complex behavior.<br><br>It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you.<br><br>It can attack.<br><br>It can do all kinds of stuff.<br><br>But we don&#39;t consider the alligator very intelligent, not in a human sort of way.<br><br>But it has all this complex behavior already.<br><br>Now in evolution, what happened?<br><br>First thing that happened in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing called the neocortex.<br><br>I&#39;m going to represent the neocortex by this box on top of the old brain.<br><br>Neocortex means &quot;new layer.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a new layer on top of your brain.<br><br>It&#39;s the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn&#39;t fit.<br><br>(Laughter) Literally, it&#39;s about the size of a table napkin and doesn&#39;t fit, so it&#39;s wrinkly.<br><br>Now, look at how I&#39;ve drawn this.<br><br>The old brain is still there.<br><br>You still have that alligator brain.<br><br>You do. It&#39;s your emotional brain.<br><br>It&#39;s all those gut reactions you have.<br><br>On top of it, we have this memory system called the neocortex.<br><br>And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain.<br><br>So as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex.<br><br>And the neocortex is just memorizing.<br><br>It&#39;s sitting there saying, I&#39;m going to memorize all the things going on: where I&#39;ve been, people I&#39;ve seen, things I&#39;ve heard, and so on.<br><br>And in the future, when it sees something similar to that again, in a similar environment, or the exact same environment, it&#39;ll start playing it back: &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve been here before,&quot; and when you were here before, this happened next.<br><br>It allows you to predict the future.<br><br>It literally feeds back the signals into your brain; they&#39;ll let you see what&#39;s going to happen next, will let you hear the word &quot;sentence&quot; before I said it.<br><br>And it&#39;s this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions.<br><br>This is the most important slide of my talk, so I&#39;ll dwell on it a little.<br><br>And all the time you say, &quot;Oh, I can predict things,&quot; so if you&#39;re a rat and you go through a maze, and you learn the maze, next time you&#39;re in one, you have the same behavior.<br><br>But suddenly, you&#39;re smarter; you say, &quot;I recognize this maze, I know which way to go; I&#39;ve been here before; I can envision the future.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s what it&#39;s doing.<br><br>This is true for all mammals – in humans, it got a lot worse.<br><br>Humans actually developed the front of the neocortex, called the anterior part of the neocortex.<br><br>And nature did a little trick.<br><br>It copied the posterior, the back part, which is sensory, and put it in the front.<br><br>Humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front, but we use it for motor control.<br><br>So we&#39;re now able to do very sophisticated motor planning, things like that.<br><br>I don&#39;t have time to explain, but to understand how a brain works, you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works, how it is we store patterns and make predictions.<br><br>Let me give you a few examples of predictions.<br><br>I already said the word &quot;sentence.&quot;<br><br>In music, if you&#39;ve heard a song before, when you hear it, the next note pops into your head already – you anticipate it.<br><br>With an album, at the end of a song, the next song pops into your head.<br><br>It happens all the time, you make predictions.<br><br>I have this thing called the &quot;altered door&quot; thought experiment.<br><br>It says, you have a door at home; when you&#39;re here, I&#39;m changing it – I&#39;ve got a guy back at your house right now, moving the door around, moving your doorknob over two inches.<br><br>When you go home tonight, you&#39;ll put your hand out, reach for the doorknob, notice it&#39;s in the wrong spot and go, &quot;Whoa, something happened.&quot;<br><br>It may take a second, but something happened.<br><br>I can change your doorknob in other ways – make it larger, smaller, change its brass to silver, make it a lever, I can change the door; put colors on, put windows in.<br><br>I can change a thousand things about your door and in the two seconds you take to open it, you&#39;ll notice something has changed.<br><br>Now, the engineering approach, the AI approach to this, is to build a door database with all the door attributes.<br><br>And as you go up to the door, we check them off one at time: door, door, color …<br><br>We don&#39;t do that.<br><br>Your brain doesn&#39;t do that.<br><br>Your brain is making constant predictions all the time about what will happen in your environment.<br><br>As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop.<br><br>When I walk, every step, if I missed it by an eighth of an inch, I&#39;ll know something has changed.<br><br>You&#39;re constantly making predictions about your environment.<br><br>I&#39;ll talk about vision, briefly.<br><br>This is a picture of a woman.<br><br>When we look at people, our eyes saccade over two to three times a second.<br><br>We&#39;re not aware of it, but our eyes are always moving.<br><br>When we look at a face, we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth.<br><br>When your eye moves from eye to eye, if there was something else there like a nose, you&#39;d see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go, &quot;Oh, shit!&quot;<br><br>(Laughter) &quot;There&#39;s something wrong about this person.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s because you&#39;re making a prediction.<br><br>It&#39;s not like you just look over and say, &quot;What am I seeing? A nose? OK.&quot;<br><br>No, you have an expectation of what you&#39;re going to see.<br><br>Every single moment.<br><br>And finally, let&#39;s think about how we test intelligence.<br><br>We test it by prediction: What is the next word in this …?<br><br>This is to this as this is to this.<br><br>What is the next number in this sentence?<br><br>Here&#39;s three visions of an object.<br><br>What&#39;s the fourth one?<br><br>That&#39;s how we test it.<br><br>It&#39;s all about prediction.<br><br>So what is the recipe for brain theory?<br><br>First of all, we have to have the right framework.<br><br>And the framework is a memory framework, not a computational or behavior framework, it&#39;s a memory framework.<br><br>How do you store and recall these sequences of patterns?<br><br>It&#39;s spatiotemporal patterns.<br><br>Then, if in that framework, you take a bunch of theoreticians – biologists generally are not good theoreticians.<br><br>Not always, but generally, there&#39;s not a good history of theory in biology.<br><br>I&#39;ve found the best people to work with are physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who tend to think algorithmically.<br><br>Then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology.<br><br>You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms.<br><br>Anyone who tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn&#39;t tell you exactly how it&#39;s working and how the wiring works – it&#39;s not a theory.<br><br>And that&#39;s what we do at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute.<br><br>I&#39;d love to tell you we&#39;re making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back on this stage sometime in the not too distant future, to tell you about it.<br><br>I&#39;m really excited; this is not going to take 50 years.<br><br>What will brain theory look like?<br><br>First of all, it&#39;s going to be about memory.<br><br>Not like computer memory – not at all like computer memory.<br><br>It&#39;s very different.<br><br>It&#39;s a memory of very high-dimensional patterns, like the things that come from your eyes.<br><br>It&#39;s also memory of sequences: you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence.<br><br>A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time.<br><br>And these sequences are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it, and it plays back automatically.<br><br>It&#39;s an automatic playback.<br><br>And prediction of future inputs is the desired output.<br><br>And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable and you must be able to build it.<br><br>If you don&#39;t build it, you don&#39;t understand it.<br><br>One more slide.<br><br>What is this going to result in?<br><br>Are we going to really build intelligent machines?<br><br>Absolutely. And it&#39;s going to be different than people think.<br><br>No doubt that it&#39;s going to happen, in my mind.<br><br>First of all, we&#39;re going to build this stuff out of silicon.<br><br>The same techniques we use to build silicon computer memories, we can use here.<br><br>But they&#39;re very different types of memories.<br><br>And we&#39;ll attach these memories to sensors, and the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data, and learn about their environment.<br><br>Now, it&#39;s very unlikely the first things you&#39;ll see are like robots.<br><br>Not that robots aren&#39;t useful; people can build robots.<br><br>But the robotics part is the hardest part.<br><br>That&#39;s old brain. That&#39;s really hard.<br><br>The new brain is easier than the old brain.<br><br>So first we&#39;ll do things that don&#39;t require a lot of robotics.<br><br>So you&#39;re not going to see C-3PO.<br><br>You&#39;re going to see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is, what driving is and have learned that cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren&#39;t going to turn.<br><br>(Laughter) We can also do intelligent security systems.<br><br>Anytime we&#39;re basically using our brain but not doing a lot of mechanics – those are the things that will happen first.<br><br>But ultimately, the world&#39;s the limit.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how this will turn out.<br><br>I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor.<br><br>And if you talk to them, they knew what they were doing was really significant, but they didn&#39;t really know what was going to happen.<br><br>They couldn&#39;t anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff.<br><br>They just knew like, &quot;We&#39;re going to build calculators and traffic-light controllers.<br><br>But it&#39;s going to be big!&quot;<br><br>In the same way, brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology, and it will lead to unbelievable changes in the next 100 years.<br><br>And I&#39;m most excited about how we&#39;re going to use them in science.<br><br>So I think that&#39;s all my time – I&#39;m over, and I&#39;m going to end my talk right there.<br><br><br></div> ]]></content>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;私たちはしばしばコンピュータと頭脳は基本的に同じだと考えますが、でもたぶんそれよりもっと深い話です。 コンピュータは脳について多くのことを教えてくれすが、我々が脳について学ぶことはまだまだたくさんあります。脳科学の知識の進歩によって、我々のコンピューティングの理解も進化するでしょう。&lt;/p&gt;

computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression, but for the most part, that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones.<br><br>And I&#39;d like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live.<br><br>A few years ago, I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York, and the next thing I knew, I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays.<br><br>This one&#39;s called &quot;The Chase.&quot;<br><br>There are two pairs of shoes, a man&#39;s pair and a woman&#39;s pair, and they play out this slow, tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her personal space, and then she moves away.<br><br>Each of the shoes has magnets in it, and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around.<br><br>My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork&#39;s Biophilia tour and I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music.<br><br>The harp has four separate pendulums, and each pendulum has 11 strings, so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes, and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music.<br><br>I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen.<br><br>And the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit, and a researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on.<br><br>And she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit, and were helping people learn in a social way.<br><br>And when you think about it, this makes a lot of sense, that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily.<br><br>I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects.<br><br>Think about which you find easier to use, a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone?<br><br>But the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch, down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software.<br><br>I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building something from scratch every single time.<br><br>So my first attempt at this was at the MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii, and we built this array of 512 different electromagnets, and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface.<br><br>But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over 10,000 dollars.<br><br>Although each one was pretty small, altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag.<br><br>So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface.<br><br>So to explore this idea, I built an army of small robots, and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels.<br><br>They&#39;re these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions, and when you couple these robots with a video projector, you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information.<br><br>So here&#39;s an example of what I mean.<br><br>This is a video editing application where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical.<br><br>So if we want to tweak the color, we just enter the color mode, and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color, or if we want to adjust the audio, then we get two different dials for that, these physical objects.<br><br>So here the left and right channel stay in sync, but if we want to, we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time.<br><br>So the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that&#39;s designed in software.<br><br>And this is a mapping application for disaster response.<br><br>So you have these physical objects that represent police, fire and rescue, and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go, and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world.<br><br>This is a video chat application.<br><br>It&#39;s amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object.<br><br>With this interface, we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games, where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible.<br><br>But one of the areas that I&#39;m most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone.<br><br>One example of those is protein folding.<br><br>So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein, and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways.<br><br>And if we move it in a way that doesn&#39;t really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation, we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us.<br><br>So feeling what&#39;s going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction.<br><br>So we&#39;re just beginning to explore what&#39;s possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment.<br><br>Maybe this is the computer of the future.<br><br>There&#39;s no touchscreen.<br><br>There&#39;s no technology visible at all.<br><br>But when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk, the objects on the table come alive.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div> ]]></content>

(Music) I saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother&#39;s Day.<br><br>And the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom.<br><br>Another one was an interactive project where, when you moved the mouse over the letters of &quot;Happy Mom Day,&quot; it reveals a special happy Mother&#39;s Day slogan.<br><br>(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative about how she had Googled to find out when Mother&#39;s Day was happening.<br><br>(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother&#39;s Day was happening, she delivered a special Mother&#39;s Day greeting of how much she loved her mom.<br><br>So I really enjoyed looking at these projects and interacting with these projects.<br><br>In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project, I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter) And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.<br><br>She wrote back to me and she said, &quot;I&#39;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make Mother&#39;s Day cards for their mothers.&quot;<br><br>So my mom was happy, and that made me happy, but actually I was even happier for another reason.<br><br>I was happy because these kids were using Scratch just in the way that we had hoped that they would.<br><br>As they created their interactive Mother&#39;s Day cards, you could see that they were really becoming fluent with new technologies.<br><br>What do I mean by fluent?<br><br>I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves and to start expressing their ideas.<br><br>When you become fluent with language, it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.<br><br>And it&#39;s similar with new technologies.<br><br>By writing, be creating these interactive Mother&#39;s Day cards, these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies.<br><br>Now maybe you won&#39;t be so surprised by this, because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.<br><br>I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as &quot;digital natives.&quot;<br><br>But actually I&#39;m sort of skeptical about this term.<br><br>I&#39;m not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.<br><br>When you really look at it, how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies?<br><br>You often see them in situations like this, or like this, and there&#39;s no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming.<br><br>But that doesn&#39;t really make you fluent.<br><br>So young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies, but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies.<br><br>It&#39;s almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies.<br><br>And I&#39;m really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies?<br><br>And that really means that they need to be able to write their own computer programs, or code.<br><br>So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize the importance of learning to code.<br><br>You know, in recent years, there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code.<br><br>You look online, you&#39;ll see places like Codecademy and events like CoderDojo and sites like Girls Who Code, or Black Girls Code.<br><br>It seems that everybody is getting into the act.<br><br>You know, just at the beginning of this year, at the turn of the new year, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg made a New Year&#39;s resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012.<br><br>A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that all of its first graders should learn to code.<br><br>And that triggered a debate in the U.K.<br><br>about whether all the children there should learn to code.<br><br>Now, for some of you, when you hear about this, it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.<br><br>When many people think of coding, they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub-community of people are going to be doing, and they think of coding looking like this.<br><br>And in fact, if this is what coding is like, it will only be a narrow sub-community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code.<br><br>But coding doesn&#39;t have to be like this.<br><br>Let me show you about what it&#39;s like to code in Scratch.<br><br>So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.<br><br>In this case, you take a move block, snap it into a stack, and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story, in this case controlling the big fish.<br><br>After you&#39;ve created your program, you can click on &quot;share,&quot; and then share your project with other people, so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well.<br><br>So, of course, making a fish game isn&#39;t the only thing you can do with Scratch.<br><br>Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website, there&#39;s everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork, and, yes, interactive Mother&#39;s Day cards.<br><br>So I think there&#39;s so many different ways that people can express themselves using this, to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.<br><br>And it doesn&#39;t just stay on the screen.<br><br>You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example from Hong Kong, where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor, so the light sensor detects the hole in the board, so as they move the physical saw, the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree.<br><br>We&#39;re going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us.<br><br>This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we&#39;ll be releasing in the next few months, and we&#39;re looking again to be able to push you in new directions.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example.<br><br>It uses the webcam.<br><br>And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug.<br><br>So it&#39;s a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world.<br><br>But instead of just playing someone else&#39;s game, you get to create the games, and if you see someone else&#39;s game, you can just say &quot;see inside,&quot; and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.<br><br>So there&#39;s a new block that says how much video motion there is, and then, if there&#39;s so much video motion, it will then tell the balloon to pop.<br><br>The same way that this uses the camera to get information into Scratch, you can also use the microphone.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example of a project using the microphone.<br><br>So I&#39;m going to let all of you control this game using your voices.<br><br>(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping) (Laughter) (Applause) As kids are creating projects like this, they&#39;re learning to code, but even more importantly, they&#39;re coding to learn.<br><br>Because as they learn to code, it enables them to learn many other things, opens up many new opportunities for learning.<br><br>Again, it&#39;s useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.<br><br>When you learn to read and write, it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things.<br><br>When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.<br><br>And it&#39;s the same thing with coding.<br><br>If you learn to code, you can code to learn.<br><br>Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.<br><br>You learn more about how computers work.<br><br>But that&#39;s just where it starts.<br><br>When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn many other things.<br><br>Let me show you an example.<br><br>Here&#39;s another project, and I saw this when I was visiting one of the computer clubhouses.<br><br>These are after-school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low-income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.<br><br>And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago, I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one, and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game, but also he wanted to do more.<br><br>He wanted to keep score.<br><br>So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish, but he wanted to keep score, so that each time the big fish eats the little fish, the score would go up and it would keep track, and he didn&#39;t know how to do that.<br><br>So I showed him.<br><br>In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.<br><br>I&#39;ll call it score.<br><br>And that creates some new blocks for you, and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score, so each time I click on &quot;change score,&quot; it increments the score.<br><br>So I showed this to the clubhouse member – let&#39;s call him Victor – and Victor, when he saw that this block would let him increment the score, he knew exactly what to do.<br><br>He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.<br><br>So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish, he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.<br><br>And it&#39;s in fact working.<br><br>And he saw this, and he was so excited, he reached his hand out to me, and he said, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;<br><br>And what went through my mind was, how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables? (Laughter) It doesn&#39;t happen in most classrooms, but that&#39;s because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables, they don&#39;t know why they&#39;re learning it.<br><br>It&#39;s nothing that, really, they can make use of.<br><br>When you learn ideas like this in Scratch, you can learn it in a way that&#39;s really meaningful and motivating for you, that you can understand the reason for learning variables, and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better.<br><br>Victor had, I&#39;m sure, been taught about variables in schools, but he really didn&#39;t – he wasn&#39;t paying attention.<br><br>Now he had a reason for learning variables.<br><br>So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn, you&#39;re learning it in a meaningful context, and that&#39;s the best way of learning things.<br><br>So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this, they&#39;re learning important concepts like variables, but that&#39;s just the start.<br><br>As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts, he was also learning about the process of design, how to start with the glimmer of an idea and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project like you see here.<br><br>So he was learning many different core principles of design, about how to experiment with new ideas, how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts, how to collaborate with other people on your projects, about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong, how to keep persistent and to persevere in the face of frustrations when things aren&#39;t working well.<br><br>Now those are important skills that aren&#39;t just relevant for coding.<br><br>They&#39;re relevant for all sorts of different activities.<br><br>Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist?<br><br>It&#39;s probably not so likely, but regardless of what he does, he&#39;ll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.<br><br>Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer, that these ideas are useful for everybody.<br><br>Again, it&#39;s useful to think about this analogy with language.<br><br>When you become fluent with reading and writing, it&#39;s not something that you&#39;re doing just to become a professional writer.<br><br>Very few people become professional writers.<br><br>But it&#39;s useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.<br><br>Again, the same thing with coding.<br><br>Most people won&#39;t grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers, but those skills of thinking creatively, reasoning systematically, working collaboratively – skills you develop when you code in Scratch – are things that people can use no matter what they&#39;re doing in their work lives.<br><br>And it&#39;s not just about your work life.<br><br>Coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.<br><br>Let me end with just one more example.<br><br>So this is an example that came from after I had sent the Mother&#39;s Day cards to my mom, she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.<br><br>So she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.<br><br>Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design, and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.<br><br>But working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself.<br><br>So as we take a look and we see that Michael Bloomberg is learning to code, all of the children of Estonia learn to code, even my mom has learned to code, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s about time that you might be thinking about learning to code?<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in giving it a try, I&#39;d encourage you to go to the Scratch website.<br><br>It&#39;s scratch.mit.edu, and give a try at coding.<br><br>Thanks very much.

      &lt;h2 id=&quot;質問：&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#質問：&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;質問：&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;質問：&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;次のコードスニペットがあるんだけど、&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;addLinks&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i=&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, link; i&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;; i++) &amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        link = &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.createElement(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        link.innerHTML = &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Link &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + i;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        link.onclick = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            alert(i);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &amp;#125;;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.body.appendChild(link);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上記のコードは、5つのリンクを生成して、現在のリンクIDを表示するために各リンクをアラートイベントでバインドするためのコード。&lt;br&gt;でも、動作しないんだ。クリックすると生成されたリンクはすべて「リンク5」になる。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;でも、次のコードスニペットは僕の期待通りに機能する。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;addLinks&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i=&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, link; i&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;; i++) &amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        link = &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.createElement(&lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        link.innerHTML = &lt;span class=&quot;string&quot;&gt;&quot;Link &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + i;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        link.onclick = &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/span&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                alert(num);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            &amp;#125;;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &amp;#125;(i);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;built_in&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.body.appendChild(link);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &amp;#125;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;上記の2つのスニペットは&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1451009/javascript-infamous-loop-issue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;ここから拝借した&lt;/a&gt;。著者の解説にあるように、&lt;strong&gt;closure&lt;/strong&gt;は魔法のように見える。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;でも、どのように動作し、どのように&lt;strong&gt;クロージャ&lt;/strong&gt;が動作するかは、僕には理解不能。なぜ最初のものは動作しないの？誰かこの魔法の詳細な説明ってできる？&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;よろしくお願いします。。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;どうやったらデータベース的、すなわち、&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;SQLみたいなjoin&lt;/a&gt;ができる？つまり、&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df1&lt;/code&gt;と&lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;の&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Inner_join&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;inner join&lt;/a&gt;：&lt;br&gt;左側のテーブルが右側のテーブルに一致するキーがある行のみを返す。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df1&lt;/code&gt;と&lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;の&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Outer_join&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;外部結合&lt;/a&gt;：&lt;br&gt;両方のテーブルのすべての行を返し、右側のテーブルの一致するキーがある左側のテーブルからレコードは結合する。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df1&lt;/code&gt;と&lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;の&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Left_outer_join&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;left outer join(または単にleft join)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;左のテーブルからすべての行と、右側からマッチするキーが有るすべての行を返す&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;df1&lt;/code&gt;と&lt;code&gt;df2&lt;/code&gt;の&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Right_outer_join&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;right outer join&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;右側のテーブルからすべての行を返し、さらに左側から一致するキーを持つ行の全てを返す&lt;br&gt;左のテーブル。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;おまけ：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;どのやったらSQLっぽいのselect文を実行できる？&lt;/p&gt;

Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know –<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And that would happen every single paper.<br><br>But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you’re supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I’d start off light, and I’d bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right?<br><br>But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn’t quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And then –<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn’t really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters – humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters – sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline.<br><br>I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it’s the school. And they say, “Is this Tim Urban?” And I say, “Yeah.” And they say, “We need to talk about your thesis.” And I say, “OK.” And they say, “It’s the best one we’ve ever seen.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>(Applause)<br><br>That did not happen.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>It was a very, very bad thesis.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, “This guy is amazing!”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I’m a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you’re not a trained brain expert, it’s not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here’s the brain of a non-procrastinator.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>Now … here’s my brain.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator’s brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything’s fine until this happens.<br><br>[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]<br><br>So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn’t like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, “Actually, let’s read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>Then –<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>Then we’re going to go over to the fridge, to see if there’s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we’re going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber’s mom.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>“All of that’s going to take a while, so we’re not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!”<br><br>(Sigh)<br><br>Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun.<br><br>Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you’re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you’re a huge success!<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK. But, if you haven’t noticed, now we’re not in tribal times. We’re in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you’re having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That’s why there’s an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that’s when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that’s entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It’s where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn’t actually fun, because it’s completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred – all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?<br><br>Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who’s always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments – someone called the Panic Monster.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there’s danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he’s the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>Now, of course, I said yes. It’s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>(Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying, “Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what’s going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now.” And the Monkey said, “Totally agree, but let’s just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India.”<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So that’s what we did that day.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up?<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system’s in mayhem.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And the Monkey – remember, he’s terrified of the Panic Monster – boom, he’s up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk.<br><br>Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters – this is the procrastinator’s system. It’s not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.<br><br>When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students.<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>And they were all writing, saying the same thing: “I have this problem too.” But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator’s system works, then what’s going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place?<br><br>Well, it turns out that there’s two kinds of procrastination. Everything I’ve talked about today, the examples I’ve given, they all have deadlines. And when there’s deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there’s a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you’re a self-starter – something in the arts, something entrepreneurial – there’s no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing’s happening, not until you’ve gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There’s also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don’t involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn’t working.<br><br>Now if the procrastinator’s only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that’s a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn’t show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they’re not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it’s this long-term kind of procrastination that’s much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It’s usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that’s why those people are emailing, and that’s why they’re in such a bad place. It’s not that they’re cramming for some project. It’s that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn’t achieve their dreams; it’s that they weren’t even able to start chasing them.<br><br>So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany – that I don’t think non-procrastinators exist. That’s right – I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey’s sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren’t there.<br><br>Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That’s one box for every week of a 90-year life. That’s not that many boxes, especially since we’ve already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we’re really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That’s a job for all of us. And because there’s not that many boxes on there, it’s a job that should probably start today.<br><br>Well, maybe not today, but …<br><br>(Laughter)<br><br>You know. Sometime soon.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>(Applause)<br></div>]]></content>
